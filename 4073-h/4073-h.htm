<h2>PREFACE.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">The</span> illustrations to this book are
mainly collotype photographs by Messrs. Maclure, Macdonald &amp;
Co., of Glasgow.&nbsp; Notwithstanding all their care, it cannot
be pretended that the result is equal to what would have been
obtained from photogravure; I found, however, that to give
anything like an adequate number of photogravures would have made
the book so expensive that I was reluctantly compelled to abandon
the idea.</p>
<p>As these sheets leave my hands, my attention is called to a
pleasant article by Miss Alice Greene about Varallo, that
appeared in <i>The Queen</i> for Saturday, April 21, 1888.&nbsp;
The article is very nicely illustrated, and gives a good idea of
the place.&nbsp; Of the Sacro Monte Miss Greene
says:&mdash;&ldquo;On the Sacro Monte the tableaux are produced
in perpetuity, only the figures are not living, they are
terra-cotta statues painted and moulded in so life-like a way
that you feel that, were a man of flesh and blood to get mixed up
with the crowd behind the grating, you would have hard work to
distinguish him from the figures that have never had
life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I should wish to modify in some respects the conclusion
arrived at on pp. 148, 149, about Michael Angelo Rossetti&rsquo;s
having been the principal sculptor of the Massacre of the
Innocents chapel.&nbsp; There can be no doubt that Rossetti did
the figure which he has signed, and several others in the
chapel.&nbsp; One of those which are probably by him (the soldier
with outstretched arm to the left of the composition) appears in
the view of the chapel that I have given to face page 144, but on
consideration I incline against the supposition of my text,
<i>i.e.</i>, that the signature should be taken as governing the
whole work, or at any rate the greater part of it, and lean
towards accepting the external authority, which, <i>quantum
valeat</i>, is all in favour of Paracca.&nbsp; I have changed my
mind through an increasing inability to resist the opinion of
those who hold that the figures fall into two main groups, one by
the man who did the signed figure, <i>i.e.</i>, Michael Angelo
Rossetti; and another, comprising all the most vigorous,
interesting, and best placed figures, that certainly appears to
be by a much more powerful hand.&nbsp; Probably, then, Rossetti
finished Paracca&rsquo;s work and signed one figure as he did,
without any idea of claiming the whole, and believing that
Paracca&rsquo;s predominant share was too well known to make
mistake about the authorship of the work possible.&nbsp; I have
therefore in the title to the illustration given the work to
Paracca, but it must be admitted that the question is one of
great difficulty, and I can only hope that some other work of
Paracca&rsquo;s may be found which will tend to settle it.&nbsp;
I will thankfully receive information about any other such
work.</p>

<h2>ADDITIONS AND CORRECTIONS.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">Unable</span> to go to Dinant before I
published &ldquo;Ex Voto,&rdquo; I have since been there, and
have found out a good deal about Tabachetti&rsquo;s family.&nbsp;
His real name was de Wespin, and he tame of a family who had been
Copper-beaters, and hence sculptors&mdash;for the Flemish
copper-beaters made their own models&mdash;for many
generations.&nbsp; The family seems to have been the most
numerous and important in Dinant.</p>
<p>The sculptor&rsquo;s grandfather, Perp&egrave;te de Wespin,
was the first to take the sobriquet of Tabaguet, and though in
the deeds which I have seen at Namur the name is always given as
&ldquo;de Wespin,&rdquo; yet the addition of &ldquo;dit
Tabaguet&rdquo; shows that this last was the name in current
use.&nbsp; His father and mother, and a sister Jacquelinne, under
age, appear to have all died in 1587.&nbsp; Jean de Wespin, the
sculptor, is mentioned in a deed of that date as
&ldquo;expatri&eacute;,&rdquo; and he has a &ldquo;gardien&rdquo;
or &ldquo;tuteur,&rdquo; who is to take charge of his
inheritance, appointed by the Court, as though he were for some
reason unable to appoint one for himself.&nbsp; This lends colour
to Fassola&rsquo;s and Torrotti&rsquo;s statement that he lost
his reason about 1586 or 1587.&nbsp; I think it more likely,
however, considering that he was alive and doing admirable work
some fifty years after 1590, that he was the victim of some
intrigue than that he was ever really mad.&nbsp; At any rate,
about 1587 he appears to have been unable to act for himself.</p>
<p>If his sister Jacquelinne died under age in 1587, Jean is not
likely to have been then much more than thirty, so we may
conclude that he was born about 1560.&nbsp; There is some six or
eight years&rsquo; work by him remaining at Varallo, and
described as finished in the 1586 edition of Caccia.&nbsp;
Tabachetti, therefore, must have left home very young, and
probably went straight to Varallo.&nbsp; In 1586 or 1587 we lose
sight of him till 1590 or 1591, when he went to Crea, where he
did about forty chapels&mdash;almost all of which have
perished.</p>
<p>On again visiting Milan I found in the Biblioteca Nazionale a
guide-book to the Sacro Monte, which was not in the Biblioteca
Ambrosiana, and of whose existence I had never heard.&nbsp; This
guide-book was published in 1606 and reissued in 1610; it
mentions all changes since 1590, and even describes chapels not
yet in existence, but it says nothing about Tabachetti&rsquo;s
First Vision of St. Joseph chapel&mdash;the only one of his
chapels not given as completed in the 1590 edition of
Caccia.&nbsp; I had assumed too hastily that this chapel was done
just after the 1590 edition of Caccia had been published, and
just before Tabachetti left for Crea in 1590 or 1591, whereas it
now appears that it was done about 1610, during a short visit
paid by the sculptor to Varallo some twenty years after he had
left it.</p>
<p>Finding that Tabachetti returned to Varallo about 1610, I was
able to understand two or three figures in the Ecce Homo chapel
which I had long thought must be by Tabachetti, but had not
ventured to ascribe to him, inasmuch as I believed him to have
finally left Varallo some twenty years before the Ecce Homo
chapel was made.&nbsp; I have now no doubt that he lent a hand to
Giovanni D&rsquo;Enrico with this chapel, in which he has happily
left us his portrait signed with a V (doubtless standing for W, a
letter which the Italians have not got), cut on the hat before
baking, and invisible from outside the chapel.</p>
<p>

<img class='floatleft' alt=
"Seal"

"Seal"
 src="images/piis.jpg" />
</a>Signor Arienta had told me there was a seal on the back of a
figure in the Journey to Calvary chapel; on examining this I
found it to show a W, with some kind of armorial bearings
underneath.&nbsp; I have not been able to find anything like
these arms, of which I give a sketch herewith: they have no
affinity with those of the de Wespin family, unless the cups with
crosses under them are taken as modifications of the three-footed
caldrons which were never absent from the arms of Dinant
copper-beaters.&nbsp; Tabachetti (for I shall assume that the
seal was placed by him) perhaps sealed this figure as an
afterthought in 1610, being unable to cut easily into the
hard-baked clay, and if he could have Italianised the W he would
probably have done so.&nbsp; I should say that I arrived at the
Ecce Homo figure as a portrait of Tabachetti before I found the V
cut upon the hat; I found the V on examining the portrait to see
if I could find any signature.&nbsp; It stands next to a second
portrait of Leonardo da Vinci by Gaudenzio Ferrari, taken into
the Ecce Homo chapel, doubtless, on the demolition of some
earlier work by Gaudenzio on or near the same site.&nbsp; I knew
of this second portrait of Leonardo da Vinci when I published my
first edition, but did not venture to say anything about it, as
thinking that one life-sized portrait of a Leonardo da Vinci by a
Gaudenzio Ferrari was as much of a find at one time as my readers
would put up with.&nbsp; I had also known of the V on
Tabachetti&rsquo;s hat, but, having no idea that his name was de
Wespin, had not seen why this should help it to be a portrait of
Tabachetti, and had allowed the fact to escape me.</p>
<p>The figure next to Scotto in the Ecce Homo chapel is, I do not
doubt, a portrait of Giovanni D&rsquo;Enrico.&nbsp; This may
explain the tradition at Varallo that Scotto is Antonio
D&rsquo;Enrico, which cannot be.&nbsp; Next to Giovanni
D&rsquo;Enrico stands the second Leonardo da Vinci, and next to
Leonardo, as I have said, Tabachetti.&nbsp; In the chapel by
Gaudenzio, from which they were taken, the figures of Leonardo
and Scotto probably stood side by side as they still do in the
Crucifixion chapel.&nbsp; I supposed that Tabachetti and
D&rsquo;Enrico, who must have perfectly well known who they were,
separated them in order to get Giovanni D&rsquo;Enrico nearer the
grating.&nbsp; It was the presumption that we had
D&rsquo;Enrico&rsquo;s portrait between Scotto and Leonardo, and
the conviction that Tabachetti also had worked in the chapel,
that led me to examine the very beautiful figure on the father
side of Leonardo to see if I could find anything to confirm my
suspicion that it was a portrait of Tabachetti himself.</p>
<p>I do not think there can be much doubt that the Vecchietto is
also a portrait of Tabachetti done some thirty years later than
1610, nor yet do I doubt, now I know that he returned to Varallo
in 1610, that the figures of Herod and of Caiaphas are by
him.&nbsp; I believe he also at this time paid a short visit to
Orta, and did three or four figures in the left hand part of the
foreground of the Canonisation of St. Francis chapel.&nbsp; At
Montrigone, a mile or so below Borgo-Sesia station, I believe him
to have done at least two or three figures, which are very much
in his manner, and not at all like either Giacomo Ferro or
Giovanni D&rsquo;Enrico, to whom they are usually assigned.&nbsp;
These figures are some twenty-five years later than 1610, and
tend to show that Tabachetti, as an old man of over seventy, paid
a third visit to the Val-Sesia.</p>
<p>The substance of the foregoing paragraphs is published at
greater length, and with illustrations, in the number of the
<i>Universal Review</i> for November 1888, and to which I must
refer my readers.&nbsp; I have, however, here given the pith of
all that I have yet been able to find out about Tabachetti since
&ldquo;Ex Voto&rdquo; was published.&nbsp; I should like to add
the following in regard to other chapels.</p>
<p>
<a href="images/pivb.jpg">
<img class='floatright' alt=
"Monogram"
title=
"Monogram"
 src="images/pivs.jpg" />
</a>Signor Arienta has found a 1523 scrawled on the frescoes of
the Crucifixion chapel.&nbsp; I do not think this shows
necessarily that the work was more than begun at that date.&nbsp;
He has also found a monogram, which we believe to be Gaudenzio
Ferrari&rsquo;s, on the central shield with a lion on it, given
in the illustration facing p. 210.&nbsp; On further
consideration, I feel more and more inclined to think that the
frescoes in this chapel have been a good deal retouched.</p>
<p>I hardly question that the Second Vision of St. Joseph chapel
is by Tabachetti, as also the Woman of Samaria.&nbsp; The Christ
in this last chapel is a restoration.&nbsp; In a woodcut of 1640
the position of the figures is reversed, but nothing more than
the positions.</p>
<p>Lastly, the Virgin&rsquo;s mother does not have eggs east of
Milan.&nbsp; It is a Valsesian custom to give eggs beaten up with
wine and sugar to women immediately on their confinement, and I
am told that the eggs do no harm though not according to the
rules.&nbsp; I am told that Valsesian influence must always be
suspected when the Virgin&rsquo;s mother is having eggs.</p>

I.<br />
<span class="GutSmall"><i>INTRODUCTION</i></span><span
class="GutSmall">.</span></h2>
<p><span class="smcap">In</span> the preface to &ldquo;Alps and
Sanctuaries&rdquo; I apologised for passing over Varallo-Sesia,
the most important of North Italian sanctuaries, on the ground
that it required a book to itself.&nbsp; This book I will now
endeavour to supply, though well aware that I can only
imperfectly and unworthily do so.&nbsp; To treat the subject in
the detail it merits would be a task beyond my opportunities;
for, in spite of every endeavour, I have not been able to see
several works and documents, without which it is useless to try
and unravel the earlier history of the sanctuary.&nbsp; The book
by Caccia, for example, published by Sessali at Novara in 1565,
and reprinted at Brescia in 1576, is sure to turn up some day,
but I have failed to find it at Varallo, Novara (where it appears
in the catalogue, but not on the shelves), Milan, the Louvre, the
British Museum, and the Bodleian Library.&nbsp; Through the
kindness of Sac. Ant. Ceriani, I was able to learn that the
Biblioteca Ambrosiana possessed what there can be little doubt is
a later edition of this book, dated 1587, but really published at
the end of 1586, and another dated 1591, to which Signor Galloni
in his &ldquo;Uomini e fatti celebri di Valle-Sesia&rdquo; (p.
110) has called attention as the first work ever printed at
Varallo.&nbsp; But the last eight of the twenty-one years between
1565 and 1586 were eventful, and much could be at once seen by a
comparison of the 1565, 1576, and 1586 [1587] editions, about
which speculation is a waste of time while the earlier works are
wanting.&nbsp; I have been able to gather two or three
interesting facts by a comparison of the 1586 and 1591 editions,
and do not doubt that the date, for example, of
Tabachetti&rsquo;s advent to Varallo and of his great Calvary
Chapel would be settled within a very few years if the missing
books were available.</p>
<p>Another document which I have in vain tried to see is the plan
of the Sacro Monte as it stood towards the close of the sixteenth
century, made by Pellegrino Tibaldi with a view to his own
proposed alterations.&nbsp; He who is fortunate enough to gain
access to this plan&mdash;which I saw for a few minutes in 1884,
but which is now no longer at Varallo&mdash;will find a great
deal made clear to him which he will otherwise be hardly able to
find out.&nbsp; Over and above the foregoing, there is the
inventory drawn up by order of Giambattista Albertino in 1614,
and a number of other documents, to which reference will be found
in the pages of Bordiga, Galloni, Tonetti, and of the many others
who have written upon the Val Sesia and its history.&nbsp; A
twelve months&rsquo; stay in the Val Sesia would not suffice to
do justice to all the interesting and important questions which
arise wholesale as soon as the chapels on the Sacro Monte are
examined with any care.&nbsp; I shall confine myself, therefore,
to a consideration of the most remarkable features of the Sacro
Monte as it exists at present, and to doing what I can to
stimulate further study on the part of others.</p>
<p>I cannot understand how a field so interesting, and containing
treasures in so many respects unrivalled, can have remained
almost wholly untilled by the numerous English lovers of art who
yearly flock to Italy; but the fact is one on which I may perhaps
be congratulated, inasmuch as more shortcomings and errors of
judgment may be forgiven in my own book, in virtue of its being
the first to bring Varallo with any prominence before English
readers.&nbsp; That little is known about the Sacro Monte, even
by the latest and best reputed authorities on art, may be seen by
turning to Sir Henry Layard&rsquo;s recent edition of
Kugler&rsquo;s &ldquo;Handbook of Painting,&rdquo;&mdash;a work
which our leading journals of culture have received with
acclamation.&nbsp; Sir Henry Layard has evidently either never
been at Varallo, or has so completely forgotten what he saw there
that his visit no longer counts.&nbsp; He thinks, for example,
that the chapels, or, as he also calls them,
&ldquo;stations&rdquo; (which in itself should show that he has
not seen them), are on the way up to the Sacro Monte, whereas all
that need be considered are on the top.&nbsp; He thinks that the
statues generally in these supposed chapels &ldquo;on the ascent
of the Sacro Monte&rdquo; are attributed to Gaudenzio Ferrari,
whereas it is only in two or three out of some five-and-forty
that any statues are believed to be by Gaudenzio.&nbsp; He thinks
the famous sculptor Tabachetti&mdash;for famous he is in North
Italy, where he is known&mdash;was a painter, and speaks of him
as &ldquo;a local imitator&rdquo; of Gaudenzio, who
&ldquo;decorated&rdquo; other chapels, and &ldquo;whose works
only show how rapidly Gaudenzio&rsquo;s influence declined and
his school deteriorated.&rdquo;&nbsp; As a matter of fact,
Tabachetti was a Fleming and his name was Tabaquet; but this is a
detail.&nbsp; Sir Henry Layard thinks that &ldquo;Miel&rdquo; was
also &ldquo;a local imitator&rdquo; of Gaudenzio.&nbsp; It is not
likely that this painter ever worked on the Sacro Monte at all;
but if he did, Sir Henry Layard should surely know that he came
from Antwerp.&nbsp; Sir Henry Layard does not appear to know that
there are any figures in the Crucifixion Chapel of Gaudenzio, or
indeed in any of the chapels for which Gaudenzio painted
frescoes, and falls into a trap which seems almost laid on
purpose for those who would write about Varallo without having
been there, in supposing that Gaudenzio painted a Piet&agrave; on
the Sacro Monte.&nbsp; Having thus displayed the ripeness of his
knowledge as regards facts, he says that though the chapels
&ldquo;on the ascent of the Sacro Monte&rdquo; are &ldquo;objects
of wonder and admiration to the innumerable pilgrims who frequent
this sacred spot,&rdquo; yet &ldquo;the bad taste of the colour
and clothing make them highly repugnant to a cultivated
eye.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I begin to understand now how we came to buy the Blenheim
Raffaelle.</p>
<p>Finally, Sir Henry Layard says it is &ldquo;very
doubtful&rdquo; whether any of the statues were modelled or
executed by Gaudenzio Ferrari at all.&nbsp; It is a pity he has
not thought it necessary give a single reason or authority in
support of a statement so surprising.</p>
<p>Some of these blunders appear in the edition of 1874 edited by
Lady Eastlake.&nbsp; In that edition the writer evidently knows
nothing of any figures in the Crucifixion Chapel, and Sir Henry
Layard was unable to supply the omission.&nbsp; The writer in the
1874 edition says that &ldquo;Gaudenzio is seen as a modeller of
painted terra-cotta in the stations ascending to the chapel
(<i>sic</i>) on the Sacro Monte.&rdquo;&nbsp; It is from this
source that Sir Henry Layard got his idea that the chapels are on
the way up to the Sacro Monte, and that they are distinct from
those for which Gaudenzio painted frescoes on the top of the
mountain.&nbsp; Having perhaps seen photographs of the Sacro
Monte at Varese, where the chapels climb the hill along with the
road, or having perhaps actually seen the Madonna del Sasso at
Locarno, where small oratories with frescoes of the Stations of
the Cross are placed on the ascent, he thought those at Varallo
might as well remain on the ascent also, and that it would be
safe to call them &ldquo;stations.&rdquo;&nbsp; It is the writer
in the 1874 edition who first gave him or her self airs about a
cultivated eye; but he or she had the grace to put in a saving
clause to the effect that the designs in some instances were
&ldquo;full of grace.&rdquo;&nbsp; True, Sir Henry Layard has
never seen the designs; nevertheless his eye is too highly
cultivated to put up with this clause; so it has disappeared, to
make room, I suppose, for the sentence in which so much accurate
knowledge is displayed in respect to Tabachetti and Miel
d&rsquo;Anvers.&nbsp; Sir Henry Layard should keep to the good
old plan of saying that the picture would have been better if the
artist had taken more pains, and praising the works of Pietro
Perugino.&nbsp; Personally, I confess I am sorry he has never
seen the Sacro Monte.&nbsp; If he has trod on so many
ploughshares without having seen Varallo, what might he not have
achieved in the plenitude of a taste which has been cultivated in
every respect save that of not pretending to know more than one
does know, if he had actually been there, and seen some one or
two of the statues themselves?</p>
<p>I have only sampled Sir Henry Layard&rsquo;s work in respect
of two other painters, but have found no less reason to differ
from him there than here.&nbsp; I refer to his remarks about
Giovanni and Gentile Bellini.&nbsp; I must reserve the
counter-statement of my own opinion for another work, in which I
shall hope to deal with the real and supposed portraits of those
two great men.&nbsp; I will, however, take the present
opportunity of protesting against a sentence which caught my eye
in passing, and which I believe to be as fundamentally unsound as
any I ever saw written, even by a professional art critic or by a
director of a national collection.&nbsp; Sir Henry Layard, in his
chapter on Leonardo da Vinci, says&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;One thing prominently taught us by the
works of Leonardo and Raffaelle, of Michael Angelo and Titian, is
distinctly this&mdash;that purity of morals, freedom of
institutions, and sincerity of faith have nothing to do with
excellence in art.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I should prefer to say, that if the works of the four artists
above mentioned show one thing more clearly than another, it is
that neither power over line, nor knowledge of form, nor fine
sense of colour, nor facility of invention, nor any of the
marvellous gifts which three out of the four undoubtedly
possessed, will make any man&rsquo;s work live permanently in our
affections unless it is rooted in sincerity of faith and in love
towards God and man.&nbsp; More briefly, it is
&#7936;&gamma;&#8049;&pi;&eta;, or the spirit, and not
&gamma;&nu;&#8061;&sigma;&iota;&sigmaf;, or the letter, which is
the soul of all true art.&nbsp; This, it should go without
saying, applies to music, literature, and to whatever can be done
at all.&nbsp; If it has been done &ldquo;to the
Lord&rdquo;&mdash;that is to say, with sincerity and freedom from
affectation&mdash;whether with conscious effusion, as by
Gaudenzio, or with perhaps robuster unconsciousness, as by
Tabachetti, a halo will gather round it that will illumine it
though it pass through the valley of the shadow of death
itself.&nbsp; If it has been done in self-seeking, as,
<i>exceptis excipiendis</i>, by Leonardo, Titian, Michael Angelo,
and Raffaelle, it will in due course lose hold and power in
proportion to the insincerity with which it was tainted.</p>

<span class="GutSmall"><i>THE REV. S. W. KING&mdash;LANZI AND
LOMAZZO</i></span><span class="GutSmall">.</span></h2>
<p><span class="smcap">Leaving</span> Sir Henry Layard, let us
turn to one of the few English writers who have given some
attention to Varallo&mdash;I mean to the Rev. S. W. King&rsquo;s
delightful work &ldquo;The Italian Valleys of the Pennine
Alps.&rdquo;&nbsp; This author says&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;When we first visited Varallo, it was
comparatively little known to travellers, but we now found that
of late years many more had frequented it, and its beautiful
scenery and great attractions were becoming more generally and
deservedly appreciated.&nbsp; Independently of its own
picturesque situation, and its advantages as head-quarters for
exploring the neighbouring Vals and their romantic scenery, the
works which it possesses of the ancient and famous Val Sesian
school of painters and modellers are most interesting.&nbsp; At
the head of them stands first and foremost Gaudenzio Ferrari,
whose original and masterly productions ought to be far more
widely known and studied than they as yet are; and some of the
finest of them are to be found in the churches and Sacro Monte of
Varallo&rdquo; (p. 498).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Of the Sacro Monte the same writer says&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;No situation could have been more happily
chosen for the purpose intended than the little mountain rising
on the north of Varallo to a height of about 270
feet&rdquo;&mdash;[this is an error; the floor of the church on
the Sacro Monte is just 500 feet above the bridge over the
Mastallone]&mdash;&ldquo;on which the chapels, oratories, and
convents of that extraordinary creation the New Jerusalem are
grouped together.&nbsp; Besides the beauty of the site and its
convenient proximity to a town like Varallo of some 3000
inhabitants, the character of the mountain is exactly adapted for
the effective disposition of the various &lsquo;stations&rsquo;
of which it consists&rdquo;&mdash;[it does not consist of
&ldquo;stations&rdquo;]&mdash;&ldquo;and on this account chiefly
it was selected by the founder, the &lsquo;Blessed Bernardino
Caimo.&rsquo;&nbsp; A Milanese of noble family, and Vicar of the
Convent of the Minorites in Milan, and also in connection with
that of Varallo, he was specially commissioned by Pope Sixtus IV.
to visit the Sepulchre and other holy places in Palestine, and
while there took the opportunity of making copies and drawings,
with the intention of erecting a facsimile of them in his native
country.&nbsp; On his return to Italy in 1491, after examining
all the likely sites within reasonable distance of Milan, he
found the conical hills of the Val Sesia the best adapted for his
design, and fixed upon Varallo as the spot; being probably
specially attracted to it from the fact of the convent and church
of Sta. Maria delle Grazie, already described, having been
conveyed through him to the &lsquo;Minori Osservanti,&rsquo; as
appears from a brief of Innocent VIII., dated December 21,
1486.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Mr. King does not give the source from which he derived his
knowledge of the existence of this act, and I have not come
across a notice of it elsewhere, except a brief one in Signor
Galloni&rsquo;s work (p. 71), and a reference to it in the
conveyance of April 14, 1493.&nbsp; But Signor Arienta of
Varallo, whose industry in collecting materials for a history of
the Sacro Monte cannot be surpassed, showed me a transcript from
an old plan of the church of S. Maria delle Grazie, in which the
inscription on Bernardino Caimi&rsquo;s grave was given&mdash;an
inscription which (so at least I understood Signor Arienta to
say) is now covered by an altar which had been erected on the
site of the grave.&nbsp; The inscription ran:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Hic quiescunt ossa B. Bernardini Caimis
Mediolan.&nbsp; S. Montis Varalli Fundatoris An. 1486.&nbsp;
Pontif. Dipl sub die 21 Xbris.&nbsp; Mortuus est autem in hoc
coenobio An. Vulg. &AElig;r&aelig; 1499.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It would thus appear that the Sacro Monte was founded four
years earlier than the received date.&nbsp; The formal deed of
conveyance of the site on the mountain from the town to
Bernardino Caimi was not signed till the 14th of April 1493; but
the work had been already commenced, as is shown by the
inscription still remaining over the reproduction of the Holy
Sepulchre, which is dated the 17th of October 1491.&nbsp;
Probably the work was contemplated in 1486, and interrupted by B.
Caimi&rsquo;s return to Jerusalem in 1487, not to be actively
resumed till 1490.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;The first stone,&rdquo; says Mr. King,
&ldquo;was laid by Scarognini, a Milanese
&lsquo;magnifico,&rsquo; who cordially entered into the scheme;
and at his expense the Holy Sepulchre was completed, and a
hospice attached, where the founder and a number of Franciscan
brothers came to reside in 1493.&nbsp; Caimo had planned a vast
extension of this commencement, but died within three years,
leaving his designs to be carried out by his
successors.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center">. . . . .</p>
<p>&ldquo;Each oratory contains a group&mdash;in some very
numerous&mdash;of figures modelled in terra-cotta the size of
life or larger; many of them of great merit as works of art,
others very inferior and mere rubbish.&nbsp; The figures are
coloured and occasionally draped with appropriate clothing, the
resemblance to life being heightened by the addition of human
hair&rdquo;&mdash;[which, by the way, is always
horse-hair]&mdash;&ldquo;and the effect is often very
startling.&nbsp; Each chapel represents a different
&lsquo;mystery,&rsquo; and, beside the modelled figures, the
walls are decorated with frescoes.&nbsp; The front of each is
open to the air, all but a wire grating, through apertures in
which the subject may be perfectly seen in the position intended
by the designer&rdquo; (pp. 510&ndash;512).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Mr. King says, correctly, that Gaudenzio&rsquo;s earliest
remaining work on the Sacro Monte is the Chapel of the
Piet&agrave;, that originally contained the figures of Christ
bearing the cross, but from which the modelled figures were
removed, others being substituted that had no connection with the
background.&nbsp; I do not know, however, that Christ was
actually carrying the cross in the chapel as it originally
stood.&nbsp; The words of the 1587 edition of Caccia (?) stand,
&ldquo;Come il N.S. fu spogliato de suoi panni, e condotto sopra
il Monte Calvario, ch&rsquo; e fatto di bellissimo e ben inteso
relievo.&rdquo;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;The frescoes on the wall,&rdquo; he
continues, &ldquo;are particularly interesting, as having been
painted by him at the early age of nineteen&rdquo;&mdash;[Mr.
King supposes Gaudenzio Ferrari to have been born in
1484]&mdash;&ldquo;when his ambition to share in the glory and
renown of the great work was gratified by this chapel being
intrusted to him; a proof of his early talent and the just
appreciation of it.&nbsp; The frescoes are much injured, but of
the chief one there is enough to show its excellence.&nbsp; On
one side is St. John, with clasped hands gazing upwards in grief,
and the two Marys sorrowing, as a soldier in the centre seems to
forbid their following further; his helmet is embossed and gilt
as in the instances in the Franciscan church, while the two
thieves are led bound by a figure on horseback.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>These frescoes appear to me to have been not so much restored
as repainted&mdash;that is to say, where they are not almost
entirely gone.&nbsp; The green colour that now prevails in the
shadows and half-tones is alien to Gaudenzio, and cannot be
accepted as his.&nbsp; I should say, however, that my friend
Signor Arienta of Varallo differs from me on this point.&nbsp; At
any rate, the work is now little more than a ruin, and the
terra-cotta Piet&agrave; is among the least satisfactory groups
on the Sacro Monte.&nbsp; Mr. King continues:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;In the Chapel of the Adoration of the Magi
we have a work of higher merit, giving evidence of his studies
under Raphael.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here Mr. King is in some measure mistaken.&nbsp; The frescoes
in the Magi Chapel are indeed greatly finer than those in the
present Piet&agrave;, but they were painted from thirty to forty
years later, when Gaudenzio was in his prime, and it is to years
of intervening incessant effort and practice, not to any study
under Raphael, that the enlargement of style and greater freedom
of design is due.&nbsp; Gaudenzio never studied under Raphael; he
may have painted for him, and perhaps did so&mdash;no one knows
whether he did or did not&mdash;but in every branch of his art he
was incomparably Raphael&rsquo;s superior, and must have known it
perfectly well.</p>
<p>Returning to Mr. King, with whom, in the main, I am in cordial
sympathy, we read:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;The group of ten figures in terra-cotta
represents the three kings just arrived with their immediate
attendants, and alighting at the door of an inner recess, where a
light burns over the manger of Bethlehem, and in which is a
simple but exquisite group of St. Joseph, the Virgin, and
Child.&nbsp; On the walls of the chapel are painted in fresco a
crowd of followers, the varieties of whose costumes, attitudes,
and figures are most cleverly portrayed.&nbsp; In modelling the
horses which form part of the central group, Ferrari was assisted
by his pupil Fermo Stella.&rdquo;&mdash;[Fermo Stella is not
known to have been a pupil of Gaudenzio&rsquo;s, and was probably
established as a painter before Gaudenzio began to work at
all.]&mdash;&ldquo;But the greatest of all Gaudenzio&rsquo;s
achievements is the large chapel of the Crucifixion, a work of
the most extraordinary character and masterly execution.&nbsp;
His first design for the subject, on the screen of the Minorite
Church, he has here carried out in life-like figures in
terra-cotta; twenty-six of which form the centre group, embodying
the events of the Passion; while round the walls are depicted
with wonderful power a crowd of spectators, numbering some 150,
most of whom are gazing at the central figure of the Saviour on
the cross.&nbsp; The variety of expression, costume, and
character is almost infinite.&nbsp; Round the roof are twenty
angels in the most varied and graceful attitudes, deserving of
special attention; and also a hideous figure of
Lucifer.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Gaudenzio&rsquo;s devils are never quite satisfactory.&nbsp;
His angels are divine, and no one can make them cry as he
does.&nbsp; When my friend Mr. H. Festing Jones met a lovely
child crying in the streets of Varallo last summer, he said it
was crying like one of Gaudenzio&rsquo;s angels; and so it
was.&nbsp; Gaudenzio was at home with everything human, and even
superhuman, if beautiful; if it was only a case of dealing with
ugly, wicked, and disagreeable people, he knew all about this,
and could paint them if the occasion required it; but when it
came to a downright unmitigated devil, he was powerless.&nbsp; He
could never have done Tabachetti&rsquo;s serpent in the Adam and
Eve Chapel, nor yet the plausible fair-spoken devil, as in the
Temptation Chapel, also by Tabachetti.</p>
<p>To conclude my extracts from Mr. King.&nbsp; Speaking of the
Crucifixion Chapel, he says:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Though this combination of terra-cotta and
fresco may not be as highly esteemed in the present day as in the
times when this extraordinary sanctuary sprang into existence,
yet this composition must always be admired as one of the
greatest of Ferrari&rsquo;s works, and undoubtedly that on which
he lavished the full force of his genius and the collected
studies and experience of his previous artist life.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It is noteworthy, but not perhaps surprising, that this
observant, intelligent, and sympathetic writer, probably through
inability to at once understand and enter into the conventions
rendered necessary by the conditions under which works so
unfamiliar to him must be both executed and looked at, has failed
to notice the existence of Tabachetti, never mentioning his name
nor referring to one of his works&mdash;not even to the Madonna
and Child in the church of S. Gaudenzio, which one would have
thought could hardly fail to strike him.</p>

<div class="gapshortline">&nbsp;</div>
<p>Mr. King has elsewhere in his work referred both to Lanzi and
to Lomazzo in support of his very high opinion of Gaudenzio
Ferrari; it may, therefore, be as well to give extracts from each
of these writers.&nbsp; Lanzi says:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;If we examine into further particulars of
his style, we shall find Ferrari&rsquo;s warm and lively
colouring so superior to that of the Milanese artists of his day,
that we shall have no difficulty in recognising it in the
churches where he painted; the eye of the spectator is directly
attracted towards it; his carnations are natural and varied
according to his subjects; his draperies display much fancy and
originality, with middle tints blended so skilfully as to equal
the most beautiful produced by any other artist.&nbsp; And, if we
may say so,&mdash;he succeeded in representing the minds even
better than the forms of his subjects.&nbsp; He particularly
studied this branch of the art, and we seldom observe more marked
attitudes or more expressive . . . As Lomazzo, however, has dwelt
so much at length on his admirable skill both in painting and
modelling, it would be idle to insist on it further.&nbsp; But I
ought to add that it is a great reflection upon Vasari that he
did not better know or better estimate such an artist; so that
foreigners who form their opinions only from history are left
unacquainted with his merit, and have uniformly neglected to do
him justice in their writings.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Lomazzo says:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Now amongst the worthy painters who
excelled herein, Raph. Urbine was not the least who performed his
workes with a divine kind of maiesty; neither was
Polidore&rdquo;&mdash;[Polidoro Caldara da
Caravaggio]&mdash;&ldquo;much behind him in his kinde, whose
pictures seemed as it were passing furious; nor yet Andreas
Mantegna, whose vaine showed a very laborious curiositie; nor yet
Leonard Vincent&rdquo;&mdash;[Leonardo da Vinci]&mdash;&ldquo;in
whose doings there was never any error found in this point.&nbsp;
Wherof amongst all other of his works, that admirable last supper
of Christ in Refect. S. Maria de Gratia in Milane maketh most
evident proofe, in which he hath so lively expressed the passions
of the Apostles mindes in their countenances and the rest of
their bodies, that a man may boldly say the truth was nothing
superior to his representation, and neede not be afraide to
reckon it among the best works of oyle-painting (of which kind of
painting John de Bruges was the first inventor).&nbsp; For in
those Apostles you might distinctly perceive admiration, feare,
griefe, suspition, love, &amp;c.; all which were sometimes to be
seen together in one of them, and finally in Judas a
treason-plotting countenance, as it were the very true
counterfiet of a traitor.&nbsp; So that therein he has left a
sufficient argument of his rare perfection, in the true
understanding of the passions of the mind exemplified outwardly
in the bodie.&nbsp; Which because it is the most necessary part
of painting, I purpose (as I say) to handle in this present
booke.&nbsp; I may not omit Mi. Angelo in any case, whose skill
and painfulnesse in this point was so greate, that his pictures
carry with them more hard motions expressed after an unusual
manner, but all of them tending to a certaine bould
stoutnesse.&nbsp; And as for Titian, he hath worthely purchased
the name of a great painter in this matter, as his pictures do
sufficiently witness; in each whereof there shineth a certain
mooving vertue, seeming to incite the beholder unto the imitation
thereof.&nbsp; Of whom this saying may well be verified, that he
was beloved of the world and envied of nature.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Finally, mine old Master Gaudentius (though he be not
much knowne) was inferior unto fewe, in giving the apt motions to
the Saintes and Angels; who was not onely a very witty painter
(as I have elsewhere showed), but also a most profound
philosopher and mathematician.&nbsp; Amongst all whose
all-praiseworthy workes (which are almost infinite, especially in
this point of motion) there are divers mysteries of
Christe&rsquo;s passion, of his doing, but chiefly a crucifix
called Mount Calvary at the Sepulchre of Varallo; where he hath
made admirable horses and strange angels, not only in painting,
but also in plasticke, of a kinde of earth wrought most curiously
with his own hand cleane rounde&rdquo;&mdash;[<i>di tutto
rilievo</i>]&mdash;&ldquo;through all the figures.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Besides in the vault of the Chappell of S. Mary de
Gratia in Milane he hath wrought most naturall angels, I meane
especially for their actions; there is also that mighty cube of
St. Mary de Serono, the Cupola of S. Maria at Saronno, full of
thrones of angells set out with actions and habites of all
sortes, carrying diversity of most strange instruments in their
hands.&nbsp; I may not conceal that goodly chapel which he made
in his latter time, in the Church of Peace in Milan, where you
shall find small histories of our Lady and Joachime showing such
superexcellent motions that they seem much to revive and animate
the spectators.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Moreover, the story of S. Roccho done by him in
Vercelli, with divers workes in that city; although indeede
almost all Lombardy be adorned with his most rare workes, I will
not conceal one saying, which was that all painters delight to
steale other men&rsquo;s inventions, but that he himself was in
no great danger of being detected of theft hereafter.&nbsp; Now
this great painter, although in reason he might for his
discretion, wisedome, and worth be compared with the above named
in the first booke, cap. 29, yet notwithstanding is he omitted by
George Vasary in his lives of the famous painters, carvers, and
architects.&nbsp; An argument, to say no worse of him, that he
intended to eternise only his own Tuscanes.&nbsp; But I proceede
to the unfoulding of the originall causes of these motions.&nbsp;
And first for our better understanding I will beginne with those
passions of the mind whereby the body is mooved to the
performance of his particular effects&rdquo; (Id., Book ii. pp.
7, 8).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>What Gaudenzio said was that all painters were fond of
stealing, but that they were pretty sure to be found out sooner
or later.</p>
<p>For my own part, I should like to say that I prefer Giovanni
Bellini to Gaudenzio; but unless Giotto and Giorgione, I really
do not know who the Italian painters should stand before
him.&nbsp; Bernardino Luini runs him close, but great as
Bernardino Luini was, Gaudenzio, in spite of not a little
mannerism, was greater.</p>
<p>The passage above referred to by Lomazzo as from his
twenty-ninth chapter runs:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Now if any man be desirous to learne the
most exact and smallest parts of these proportions, together with
the way how to transfer them from one body to another, I refer
him to the works of Le. Vincent, Bramante, Vincentius Foppa,
Barnard Zenale; and for prints to Albert Durer, Hispill Peum,
&amp;c.&nbsp; And out of mine owne workes he may gather that I
have endeavoured if not performed these proportions, done
according to these rules; which all the best and famous painters
of our time have likewise observed; who have also attained to the
exquisite proportions of the seven planets.&nbsp; Amongst whom
Mi. Angelo hath merited the chiefest commendation; next him Raph.
Urbine was famous for making of delicate and Venereall bodies;
Leon. Vincent for expressing of solary bodies; Polidore Caldara
of Caravaggio for Martiall bodies; Titianus Vecellino for
Lunaryes; and Gaudentius Ferrato da Valdugia a Milaner for
Jovialistes&rdquo; (55 Bk. i. p. 117).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Having been compelled to look through the greater part of
Lomazzo&rsquo;s work, inasmuch as not one of the several writers
who have referred to his high opinion of Gaudenzio has given
chapter and page, I would fain allow myself to linger somewhat in
the fascinating paths into which my subject has led me.&nbsp; I
should like to call further attention to this forgotten work as
&ldquo;Englished&rdquo; by one Richard Haydocke, &ldquo;Student
in Physik,&rdquo; and dedicated to no less a person than
&ldquo;to the Right Worshipful Thomas Bodley, Esq.,&rdquo; whose
foundation of the library that bears his name is referred to in
the preface.&nbsp; Gladly would I tell him about Alexander the
Great, who, being overmatched by his enemies in India, &ldquo;was
seen to reake forth from his bodie fier and light;&rdquo; and of
the father of Theodoricus, who, &ldquo;by the like vehement
effect, breathed out of his heart, as from a burning furnace,
fierce sparkels; which flying forth, shone, and made a sound in
the aire.&rdquo;&nbsp; I should like to explain to him about the
motions of the seven planets which are the seven governours of
the world, and how Saturn &ldquo;causeth a complexion of colour
between blacke and yeallowe, meager, distorted, of an harde
skinne, eminent vaines, an hairie bodie, small eies, eie brows
joyned together &amp;c.,&rdquo; and how &ldquo;he maketh a man
subtle, wittie, a way-layer, and murtherer;&rdquo; how, again,
Jupiter is &ldquo;magnipotent, good natured, fortunate, sweete,
pleasant, the best wel-willer, honest, neate, of a good gate,
honorable, the author of mirth and judgement, wise, true, the
revealer of truth, the chiefe judge, exceeding all the planets in
goodnesse, the bestower of riches and wisedome;&rdquo; how Mars
&ldquo;broaches bould spirites, bloud, brawles and all
disordered, inconsiderate, and headdy actions;&rdquo; how
&ldquo;his gestures are terrible, cruell, fierce, angry, proude,
hasty and violent,&rdquo; and how also &ldquo;he is reputed hoat
and drie in the highest degree, bearing sway over redde
choler.&rdquo;&nbsp; I should like to tell him about the
passions, actions, and the gestures they occasion, described as
they are with a sweet and silly unreasonableness that is very
charming to read, and makes no demand whatever upon the
understanding.&nbsp; But charming as are the pages of Lomazzo,
those of Torrotti are more charming still, and they have a
connection with our subject which Lomazzo&rsquo;s have not.&nbsp;
Enough, therefore, that Mr. Haydocke did not get through more
than half Lomazzo&rsquo;s treatise, and that, glancing over the
untranslated pages, I see frequent allusions to Gaudenzio in the
warmest terms, but no passage so important as the longer of the
two quoted above.</p>
<h1><a name="page24"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
24</span>CHAPTER III.<br />
<span class="GutSmall"><i>VARALLO</i></span><span
class="GutSmall">, </span><span class="GutSmall"><i>PAST AND
PRESENT</i></span><span class="GutSmall">.</span></h1>
<p><span class="smcap">Now</span> that Varallo can be easily
reached by the new railway from Novara, it is not likely to
remain so little known much longer.&nbsp; The town is agreeable
to stay in; it contains three excellent inns.&nbsp; I name them
in geographical order.&nbsp; They are the Italia, the Croce
Bianca, and the Posta, while there is another not less excellent
on the Sacro Monte itself.&nbsp; I have stayed at all these inns,
and have received so much kindness in each of them, that I must
decline the invidious task of recommending any one of them
especially.&nbsp; My book is intended for Varallo, and not for
this or that hotel.&nbsp; The neighbourhood affords numberless
excursions, all of them full of interest and beauty; the town
itself, though no exception to the rule that the eastern cities
of North Italy are more beautiful than the western, is still full
of admirable subjects for those who are fond of sketching.&nbsp;
The people are hospitable to a fault; personally, I owe them the
greatest honour that has ever been conferred upon me&mdash;an
honour far greater than any I have ever received among those who
know me better, and are probably better judges of my
deserts.&nbsp; The climate is healthy, the nights being cool even
in the height of summer, and the days almost invariably sunny and
free from fog in winter.&nbsp; With all these advantages,
therefore, it is not easy to understand the neglect that has
befallen it, except on the ground that until lately it has been
singularly difficult of access.</p>
<p>Two hundred years ago it must have been much as it is at
present.&nbsp; Turning to the work of the excellent Canon
Torrotti, published in 1686, I find he writes as
follows:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Oh, what fannings is there not here,&rdquo;
he exclaims, &ldquo;of the assiduous Zephyrs; what warmth in
winter, what gelidness of the air in summer; and what freaks are
there not of Nature by way of caves, grottoes, and delicious
chambers hewn by her own hand.&nbsp; Here can be enjoyed wines of
the very finest flavour, trout as dainty as can be caught in any
waters, game of the most singular excellence; in short, there is
here a great commodity of everything most sensual and pleasing to
the palate.&nbsp; And of those who come here, above all I must
praise the Piedmontese, who arrive in frequent cavalcades of from
twenty to five-and-twenty people, to an edification which is
beyond all praise; and they are munificent in the gifts they
leave behind them to the Holy Place&mdash;not resembling those
who are mean towards God though they will spend freely enough
upon their hotel-bill.&nbsp; Carriages of all sorts can be had
here easily; it is the Milanese who for the most part make use of
these carriages and equipages, for they are pompous and splendid
in their carryings on.&nbsp; From elsewhither processions arrive
daily, even from Switzerland, and there are sometimes as many as
ten thousand visitors extraordinary come here in a single day,
yet is there no hindrance but they find comfortable lodging, and
at very reasonable prices.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As for the distance, it is about sixty miles, or two
easy days&rsquo; journey from Milan; it is much the same from
Turin; it is one day from Novara, and one from Vercelli; but the
most delightful thing about this journey is that you can combine
so many other devotions along with it.&nbsp; In the Milanese
district, for example, there is the mountain of Varese, and that
of S. Carlo of Arona on the Lago Maggiore; and there are S.
Francesco and S. Giulio on the Lago d&rsquo;Orta; then there is
the Madonna of Oropa in the mountains of Biella, which sanctuary
is in the diocese of Vercelli, as is also S. Giovanni di
Campiglio, the Madonna di Crevacore, and Gattinara; there is also
the Mount Calvary of Domo d&rsquo;Ossola, on the road towards
Switzerland, and Montrigone below Borgosesia.&nbsp; These,
indeed, are but chapels in imitation of our own Holy Sepulchre,
and cannot compare with it neither in opulence nor in importance;
still those of Varese and Oropa are of some note and
wealth.&nbsp; Moreover, the neighbourhood of this our own
Jerusalem is the exact counterpart of that which is in the Holy
Land, having the Mastallone on the one side for the brook Kedron,
and the Sesia for the Jordan, and the lake of Orta for that of
C&aelig;sar&aelig;a; while for the Levites there are the fathers
of St. Bernard of Mentone in the Graian and Pennine Alps of
Aosta, where there are so many Roman antiquities that they may be
contemplated not only as monuments of empire, but as also of the
vanity of all human greatness&rdquo; (pp. 19&ndash;21).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A little later the Canon tells us of the antiquity of the
councils that have been held in the neighbourhood, and of one
especially:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Which was held secretly by five bishops on
the summit of one of the mountains of Sorba in the Val Rassa,
which is still hence called the bishops&rsquo; seat; for they
came thither as to the place where the five dioceses adjoined,
and each one sat on a stone within the boundary of his own
diocese; and they are those of Novara, Vercelli, Ivrea, Orta, and
Sion.&nbsp; Nor must we forget the signal service rendered to the
universal church in these same mountains of Rassa by the
discomfiture of the heretic monks Gazzari to which end Pope
Clement V. in 1307 issued several bulls, and among them one
bearing date on the third day of the ides of August, given at
Pottieri, in which he confirmed the liberty of our people, and
acknowledged the Capi as Counts of the Church . . . For the
Valsesian people have been ever free, and by God&rsquo;s grace
have shaken off the yoke of usurpers while continuing faithful
and profitable subjects of those who have equitably protected
them.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Torrotti goes on to tell us about the Blessed shepherdess
Panesia, a virgin of the most exquisite beauty, and only fifteen
years old, who was martyred on the 1st of May 1383 on the
mountain of S. Giovanni of Quarona, with three wounds on her head
and two on her throat, inflicted by a wicked stepmother who had a
devil, and whose behests she had obeyed with such consummate
sweetness that she had attained perfection; on which, so
invariably do extremes meet, she had to be put to death and made
a martyr; and if we want to know more about her, we can find it
in the work that has been so elegantly written about her by the
most illustrious Father Castiglione Sommasco.&nbsp; Again, there
was the famous miracle in 1333 of S. Maiolo in Val Rassa, which
is celebrated every year, and in virtue of which Pietro, only
child of Viscount Emiliano, one of the three brothers who fought
against the heretics, was saved after having been carried off by
a ravenous wolf into the woods of Val Sorba as far as the
fountain named after the rout which this same Count, when he
afterwards grew up, inflicted upon the enemies of the valley in
1377; wherefore he is seen in an old picture of those times as a
child in swaddling-clothes in the mouth of a wolf, and he gave
the name of Fassola di S. Maiolo to his descendants.&nbsp; Nor,
as in private duty bound, can the worthy Canon forget&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;My own beloved chapel of St. Mary of the
Snow, for whose honour and glory I have done my utmost, at the
entrance of the Val Mastallone; for here on a fragment of ruined
wall there grow at all times sundry flowers, even in the ice and
snows of winter; wherefore I had the distich set up where it may
be now seen.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I have never seen it, but must search for it next time I go to
Varallo.&nbsp; Torrotti presently says that the country being
sterile, the people are hard pressed for food during two-thirds
of the year; hence they have betaken themselves to commerce and
to sundry arts, with which they overrun the world, returning home
but once or twice a year, with their hands well filled with that
which they have garnered, to sustain and comfort themselves with
their families; and their toil and the gains that they have made
redound no little to the advantage of the states of Milan and
Piedmont.&nbsp; He again declares that they maintain their
liberty, neither will they brook the least infringement
thereon.&nbsp; And their neighbours, he continues, as well as the
dwellers in the valley itself, are interested in this; for here,
as in some desert or peaceful wilderness, the noble families of
Italy and neighbouring provinces have been ever prone to harbour
in times of war and trouble.</p>
<p>Then, later, there comes an account of a battle, which I
cannot very well understand, but it seems to have been fought on
the 26th of July 1655.&nbsp; The Savoyards were on their way to
assist at a siege of Pavia, and were determined to punish the
Valsesians <i>en route</i>; they had come up from Romagnano to
Borgosesia, when the Valsesians attacked them as they were at
dinner, and shot off the finger of a general officer who was
eating an egg; on this the battle became general, and the
Savoyards were caught every way; for the waters of the Sesia had
come down in flood during the night.&nbsp; The Germans of Alagna,
Rima, and Rimella were in it, somehow, and those of Pregemella in
the Val Dobbia.&nbsp; I cannot make out whether the Pregemella
people were Germans or merely people; either way, the
German-speaking villages in the Val Sesia appear to have been the
same two hundred years ago as now.&nbsp; I mean, it does not seem
that the German-speaking race extended lower down the valley then
than now.&nbsp; But at any rate, the queen, or whoever
&ldquo;Madama Reale&rdquo; may be, was very angry about the
battle.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;It is the custom,&rdquo; concludes our
author, &ldquo;in token of holy cheerfulness (<i>allegria
spirituale</i>) to wear a sprig of pine in the hat on leaving the
holy place, to show that the visitor has been there; for it has
some fine pine trees.&nbsp; This custom was introduced in royal
merriment by Carlo Emmanuele I.&nbsp; He put a sprig in his hat,
and was imitated by all his court, and the ladies wore the same
in their bosom or in their hair.&nbsp; Assuredly it is one of the
wonders of the world to see here, amid the amenities and
allurements of the country, especially during the summer season,
what a continuous <i>festa</i> or holy fair is maintained.&nbsp;
For there come and go torrents of men and women of every nation
under heaven.&nbsp; Here you shall see pilgrims and persons in
religion of every description, processions, prelates, and often
princes and princesses, carriages, litters, cal&ecirc;ches,
equipages, cavalcades accompanied by trumpeters, gay troops of
cavaliers, and ladies with plumes in their hats and rich apparel
wherewithal to make themselves attractive; and at intervals you
shall hear all manner of songs, concerts, and musical
instruments, both civil and military, all done with a modest and
devout cheerfulness of demeanour, by which I am reminded of
nothing so strongly as of the words of the Psalmist in the which
he saith &lsquo;Come and see the works of the Lord, for He hath
done wonders upon earth.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It must have been something like our own Tunbridge Wells or
Bath in the last century.&nbsp; Indeed, one is tempted to think
that if the sea had come up to Varallo, it must have been almost
more like Margate than Jerusalem.&nbsp; Nor can we forget the
gentle rebuke administered on an earlier page to those who came
neither on business nor for devotion&rsquo;s sake, but out of
mere idle curiosity, and bringing with them company which the
good Canon designates as scandalous.&nbsp; <i>Mais nous avons
chang&eacute; tout cela</i>.</p>
<p>I have allowed myself to quote so freely from Torrotti, as
thinking that the reader will glean more incidentally from these
fragments about the genius of Varallo and its antecedents than he
would get from pages of disquisition on my own part.&nbsp;
Returning to the Varallo of modern times, I would say that even
now that the railway has been opened, the pleasantest way of
getting there is still over the Colma from Pella opposite
Orta.&nbsp; I always call this road &ldquo;the root,&rdquo; for I
once saw it thus described, obviously in good faith, in the
visitors&rsquo; book at one of the inns in Varallo.&nbsp; The
gentleman said he had found &ldquo;the root&rdquo; without any
difficulty at Pella, had taken it all the way to Varallo, and it
was delicious.&nbsp; He said it was one of the finest
&ldquo;roots&rdquo; he had ever seen, and it was only nine or ten
miles long.</p>
<p>There were one or two other things in that book, of which,
while I am about it, I should like to deliver my mind.&nbsp; A
certain man who wrote a bold round hand signed his name
&ldquo;Tom Taylor&rdquo;&mdash;doubtless not the late well-known
art critic and dramatic writer, but some other person of the same
name&mdash;in the visitors&rsquo; book of the Hotel Leone
d&rsquo;Oro at Orta, and added the word
&ldquo;disgusted.&rdquo;&nbsp; I saw this entry, then
comparatively recent, in 1871, and on going on to the Hotel
d&rsquo;Italia at Varallo, found it repeated&mdash;&ldquo;Tom
Taylor disgusted.&rdquo;&nbsp; The entries in each case were
probably aimed at the Sacro Monte, and not at the inn; but they
grated on me, as they must have done on many other English
visitors; and I saw with pleasure that some one had written
against the second of them the following epigram, which is too
neat not to be preserved.&nbsp; It ran:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Oh wretched Tom Taylor, disgusted at
Orta,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; At Varallo we find him disgusted again;<br />
The feeling&rsquo;s contagious, I really have caught a<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Disgust for Tom Taylor&mdash;he travels in
vain.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Who, I wonder, was it who could fling off such an apt
impromptu, and how many more mute inglorious writers have we not
who might do anything they chose if they would only choose to do
anything at all?&nbsp; Some one else had written on an earlier
page;&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: center">1.</p>
<p>&ldquo;While you&rsquo;ve that which makes the mare go<br />
You should stay at this albergo,</p>
<p>Bona in esse and in posse<br />
Are dispensed by Joseph Rossi.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">2.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ask him and he&rsquo;ll set before ye<br />
Vino birra e liquori,</p>
<p>Asti, Grignolino, Sherry<br />
Prezzi moderati&mdash;very.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There was more, but I have forgotten it.&nbsp; Joseph Rossi
was a famous old waiter long since retired, something like Pietro
at the Hotel Rosa Rossa at Casale, whom all that country side
knew perfectly well.&nbsp; This last entry reminds me of a
somewhat similar one which I saw some five and thirty years ago
at the inn at Harlech;&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: center">1.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Quam superba sit ruina,<br />
Ipsa sua semper laus,<br />
And the castle&mdash;nothing finer,<br />
With its ivy and jackdaws.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It is a pity the art of writing such pleasing little poems
should be now so generally neglected in favour of more ambitious
compositions.&nbsp; Whatever brevity may be as regards wit it is
certainly the soul of all agreeable poetry.</p>
<p>But again to return to Varallo, or rather to the way of
reaching it by the Colma.&nbsp; There is nothing in North Italy
more beautiful than this walk, with its park-like
chestnut-covered slopes of undulating pasture land dotted about
with the finest thatched barns to be found outside Titian.&nbsp;
We might almost fancy that Handel had it in his mind when he
wrote his divine air &ldquo;Verdi Prati.&rdquo;&nbsp; Certainly
no country can be better fitted either to the words or
music.&nbsp; It continues in full beauty all the way to Civiasco,
where the carriage road begins that now goes down into the main
road between Varallo and Novara, joining it a mile and a half or
so below Varallo.</p>
<p>Close to the point of juncture there is a chapel of singularly
graceful elegant design, called the Madonna di Loreto.&nbsp; To
this chapel I will again return: it is covered with
frescoes.&nbsp; Near it there is an open triangular piece of
grass land on which a murderer was beheaded within the memory of
persons still living.&nbsp; A wild old man, who looked like an
executioner broken loose from the flagellation chapel on the
Sacro Monte, but who was quite tame and kind to us when we came
to know him, told Jones and myself this last summer that he
remembered seeing the murderer brought here and beheaded, this
being as close as might be to the place where the murder had been
committed.&nbsp; We were at first rather sceptical, but on
inquiry at Varallo found that there had been an execution here,
the last in the open country, somewhere about the year 1835.</p>
<p>From this spot two roads lead to Varallo; one somewhat
circuitous by Mantegna, a village notable for a remarkable fresco
outside the church, in which the Virgin is appearing to a lady
and gentleman as they are lying both of them fast asleep in a
large bed, with their two dear little round heads on a couple of
comfortable pillows.&nbsp; The three Magi in the very interesting
frescoes behind the choir in the church of S. Abbondio at Como
are, if I remember, all in one bed when the angel comes to tell
them about the star, and I fancy they have a striped counterpane,
but it is some time since I saw the frescoes; at any rate the
angel was not a lady.&nbsp; We had often before seen the Virgin
appear to a lady in bed, and even to a gentleman in bed, but
never before to a lady and a gentleman both in the same
bed.&nbsp; She is not, however, so much appearing to them as
sitting upon them, and I should say she was pretty heavy.&nbsp;
The fresco is dated 1641.</p>
<p>The other road is the direct one, and passes the old church of
St. Mark, outside which there are some charming fifteenth-century
frescoes by nobody in particular, and among them a cow who, at
the instance of St. Mark, is pinning a bear or wolf to a tree in
a most resolute determined manner.</p>
<p>There are other frescoes on this church by the Varallese
painter Luini (not to be confounded with Bernardino), but I do
not remember them as remarkable.</p>
<p>Up to this point the two highest peaks of Monte Rosa are still
visible when clouds permit; here they disappear behind nearer
mountains, and in a few more hundred yards Varallo is
entered.</p>

FASSOLA</i></span><span class="GutSmall">.</span></h2>
<p><span class="smcap">In</span> geographical position Varallo is
the most western city of North Italy in which painting and
sculpture were endemic.&nbsp; Turin, Novara, Vercelli, Casale,
Ivrea, Biella, Alessandria, and Aosta have no endemic art
comparable to that of the cities east of Milan.&nbsp; Bergamo,
Brescia, Verona, Vicenza, Padua, not to mention Venice and the
cities of the Friuli, not only produced artists who have made
themselves permanently famous, but are themselves, in their
architecture and external features generally, works of art as
impressive as any they contain; they are stamped with the
widely-spread instinctive feeling for beauty with which the age
and people that reared them must assuredly have been
inspired.&nbsp; The eastern cities have perhaps suffered more
from war, nevertheless it is hard to think that the beauty so
characteristic of the eastern Lombardic cities should fail so
conspicuously, at least by comparison, in the western, if the
genius of the places had been the same.&nbsp; All cities are
symptomatic of the men who built them, towns no less than bodily
organisation being that unknown something which we call mind or
spirit made manifest in material form.&nbsp; Englishmen,
Frenchmen, Germans, and Italians&mdash;to name them in
alphabetical order, are not more distinct in their several faults
and virtues than are London, Paris, Berlin, and Rome, in the
impression they leave on those who see them.&nbsp; How closely in
each case does the appearance of the city correspond with the
genius of the nation of which it is the capital.&nbsp; The same
holds good more or less with the provincial cities of any
country.&nbsp; They have each in a minor degree their distinctive
evidences of character, and it will hardly be denied that while
the North Italian genius is indebted to the cities of Piedmont
for perhaps its more robust and vigorous elements, it owes its
command of beauty whether of form or colour to Lombardy rather
than to Piedmont.&nbsp; It seems to have been ordained that an
endemic interest in art should not cross the Po northward to the
west of the Ticino, and to this rule Varallo is only partially an
exception; the reasons which led to its being an exception at all
will be considered presently.&nbsp; I know, of course, that
Novara, and still more Vercelli, contain masterpieces by
Gaudenzio Ferrari, but in each case the art was exotic, and with
the not very noteworthy exceptions of Lanini, Difendente Ferrari
di Chivasso, and Macrino d&rsquo;Alba, I do not at the moment
call to mind the name of a single even high second-class painter
or sculptor who has hailed from west of the Valsesia.</p>
<p>The exceptional position of Varallo as regards North Italian
art must be referred mainly to its selection by Bernardino Caimi
as the site for the New Jerusalem which he founded there at the
end of the fifteenth century; a few words, therefore, concerning
him will not be out of place here; I learn from Torrotti that he
was a &ldquo;Frate Minore Osservante di S. Francesco,&rdquo; and
came of the noble and illustrious Milanese family of the Counts
Caimi.&nbsp; He had been Patriarch of the Holy Land, and, as I
find stated in Signor Galloni&rsquo;s excellent work already
referred to, <a name="citation40"></a><a href="#footnote40"
class="citation">[40]</a> had been employed on important missions
in the island of Cyprus, chiefly in connection with the
reformation of abuses.&nbsp; Full of zeal and devotion he
returned to his native country, and ere long conceived the design
of reproducing in Italy a copy of the most important sites in the
Holy Land, for the comfort and greater commodity of so many
Christians who, being unable to commit themselves to long and
weary voyages by land and sea, and among infidels, might gather
thence some portion of that spiritual fruit which were otherwise
beyond their reach.</p>
<p>Old and mendicant as he was, he was nothing daunted by the
magnitude of the task before him, and searched Lombardy from one
end to the other in his desire to provide Providence with a
suitable abode.&nbsp; For a long while he sought in vain, and
could find no place that was really like Jerusalem, but at last,
towards the end of 1491, he came to Varallo alone, and had hardly
got there before he felt himself rapt into an ecstasy, in the
which he was drawn towards the Sacro Monte; when he got up to the
plain on the top of the mountain which was then called &ldquo;La
Parete,&rdquo; perceiving at once its marvellous resemblance to
Jerusalem, even to the existence of another mountain hard by
which was like Calvary, he threw himself on the ground and
thanked God in a transport of delight.&nbsp; It is said that for
some time previously the shepherds who watched their flocks on
this solitary height had been talking of nothing but of heavenly
harmonies that had been heard coming from the sky; that Caimi
himself while yet in the Holy Land had been shown this place in a
vision; and that on reaching an eminence called Sceletta he had
been conducted to the site itself by the song of a bird which
sang with such extraordinary sweetness that he had been
constrained to follow it.</p>
<p>I should have set this bird down as a blue rock thrush or
<i>passero solitario</i>, for I know these birds breed yearly on
the Sacro Monte, and no bird sings so sweetly as they do, but we
are expressly told that Caimi did not reach Varallo till the end
of the year, and the <i>passeri solitarii</i> have all migrated
by the end of August.&nbsp; We have seen, however, that Milano
Scarrognini actually founded a chapel in October 1491, so
Torrotti is wrong in his date, and Caimi may have come in 1490,
and perhaps in August, before the <i>passeri</i> were gone.&nbsp;
There can be little doubt in fact that he came, or at any rate
chose his site, before 1486.</p>
<p>Whatever the bird may have been, Caimi now communicated his
design to the Consiglio della Vicinanza at Varallo, through
Milano de&rsquo; Scarrognini, who was a member of the body, and
who also gave support in money; negotiations were not finally
concluded until the 14th of April 1493, on which day, as we have
already seen, the site of the monastery of S. Maria della Grazie
was conveyed to the Padri dell&rsquo; Osservanza with the
concession of a right to build their New Jerusalem on the
adjoining mountain&mdash;which they had already begun to do for
some time past.</p>
<p>Divine assistance was manifest in the ease with which
everything had been arranged, but Torrotti goes on to assure us
that it was presently made still clearer.&nbsp; The design had
been to begin with a reproduction of the Holy Sepulchre, and
hardly had the workmen begun to dig for the foundation of this
first work, when a stone was found, not only resembling the one
which covered the actual Holy Sepulchre itself, but an absolute
facsimile of it in all respects&mdash;as like it, in fact, or
even more so, than Varallo was to Jerusalem.&nbsp; The testimony
to this was so notorious, and the fact was so soon and widely
known, that pilgrims flocked in crowds and brought gifts enough
to bring the first abode of the Fathers with the chapel beside it
to a speedy and successful completion.&nbsp; Everything having
been now started auspiciously, and the Blessed Bernardino having
been allowed to look, as it were, into the promised land, God
took him to Himself on the 5th day of the Ides of February 1496,
or&mdash;as I have above said that the inscription on
Caimi&rsquo;s tomb declares&mdash;in 1499.</p>
<p>The churches, both the one below the mountain in which
Gaudenzio&rsquo;s great series of frescoes may be still seen, and
the one on the top, which stood on the site now occupied by the
large house that stands to the right of the present church, and
is called the Casino, were consecrated between the 5th and 7th
days of September 1501, and by this time several of the chapels
with figures in them had been taken in hand, and were well
advanced if not completed.</p>
<p>Fassola&rsquo;s version of Bernardino Caimi&rsquo;s visit is
more guarded than Torrotti&rsquo;s is.&nbsp; Before going on to
it I will say here the little that need be said about Fassola
himself.&nbsp; I find from Signor Galloni&rsquo;s &ldquo;Uomini e
fatti&rdquo; (p. 208) that he was born at Rassa above Bucioleto
in the Val Grande, on the 19th of September 1648.&nbsp; His
family had one house at Rassa, and another at Varallo, which last
is believed to have been what is now the hotel Croce Bianca, at
which I always myself stay.&nbsp; Torrotti, in his preface,
claims to have been one of his masters; he also says that Fassola
was only eighteen when he wrote his work on the Sacro Monte, and
that he had published a work when he was only fourteen.&nbsp; The
note given by Signor Galloni [p. 233] settles it that Fassola was
born &ldquo;anno D. 1648 die 19 septembris hora 22 min.
30,&rdquo; so that either the book lay some years unpublished, or
he was over twenty when he wrote it.&nbsp; Like the edition of
Caccia already referred to, it is dated a year later than the one
in which it actually appeared, so that the present custom of
post-dating late autumn books is not a new one.&nbsp; In the
preface the writer speaks of his pen as being &ldquo;tenera non
tanto per talento quanto per l&rsquo;et&agrave;.&rdquo;&nbsp; In
the same preface he speaks of himself as having a double
capacity, one as a Delegate to the governing body of the valley,
and the other as a canon; but he must mean some kind of lay
canon, for I cannot find that he was ever ordained.&nbsp; In 1672
he published his work &ldquo;La Valsesia descritta,&rdquo; which
according to Signor Galloni is more hastily written than his
earlier work.&nbsp; On the 14th of December, the same year, he
left the Valsesia and travelled to France, keeping a journal for
some time, which Signor Galloni tells us still existed in 1873 in
the possession of Abate Cav. Carestia of Riva Valdobbia.&nbsp; He
went to Paris, and appears to have stayed there till 1683, when
he returned to Varallo, and the Valsesia.</p>
<p>He found his country torn by faction, and was immediately
hailed by all parties as the one man whom all could agree to
elect as Regent General of the Valley.&nbsp; He was elected, and
on the 5th of October convened his first general council of the
Valsesia.&nbsp; He seems to have been indefatigable as an
administrator during the short time he held office, but in the
year 1684 was deposed by the Milanese, who on the 3rd of December
sent a body of armed men to seize him and take him to
Milan.&nbsp; He was warned in time to fly, and escaped to France,
where according to some he died, while others say that he settled
in Poland and there attained high distinction.&nbsp; Nothing,
however, is known for certain about him later than the year 1684
or the beginning of 1685.</p>
<p>In 1686 Torrotti published his book.&nbsp; He says that
Fassola during his regency repeatedly desired him
&ldquo;ripigliare questa relatione per commodit&agrave; dei
Pelegrini, Divoti, visitanti,&rdquo; and that so much new matter
had come to light since Fassola&rsquo;s time that a new work was
called for.&nbsp; Fassola, he says, even in the midst of his
terrible misfortunes, continued to take the warmest interest in
his native city, and in the Sacro Monte, where it appears he had
been saluted by a very memorable and well-known miracle, which
was so well known in Torrotti&rsquo;s time that it was not
necessary to tell us what it was.&nbsp; Fassola may or may not
have urged Torrotti to write a second work upon the Sacro Monte,
but he can hardly have intended him to make it little more than a
transcript of his own book.&nbsp; If new facts had come to light
they do not appear in Torrotti&rsquo;s pages.&nbsp; He very
rarely adds to Fassola, and never corrects him; when Fassola is
wrong Torrotti is wrong also; even when something is added I have
a strong suspicion that it comes from Fassola&rsquo;s second
book.&nbsp; On the whole I am afraid I regard Torrotti as
somewhat of a plagiarist&mdash;at least as regards his matter,
for his manner is his own and is very quaint, garrulous, and
pleasing.</p>
<p>Fassola&rsquo;s work is full of inaccuracies, and of such
inaccuracies as can only be explained on the supposition that the
writer resided mainly at Rassa, wrote his book there, and relied
too much upon notes which he did not verify after his work was
written.&nbsp; Nevertheless, as Signor Galloni justly says,
&ldquo;he must be allowed the merit of having preserved an
immense mass of matter from otherwise almost certain destruction,
and his pages when subjected to rigid examination and criticism
furnish abundant material to the writer of genuine
history.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He leans generally much less towards the miraculous than
Torrotti does.&nbsp; After saying, for example, that Bernardino
Caimi had returned from Jerusalem in 1481 full of devotion and
with the fixed intention of reproducing the Holy City on Italian
soil, he continues:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;With this holy intent the good ecclesiastic
journeyed to the mountains of Biella, and thence to the Val
d&rsquo;Ossola, and thence to several places in the Valsesia,
which of all others was the valley in which he was most inclined
to unburden his mind of the treasure of his heroic design.&nbsp;
Finally, arriving at Varallo, as the place of most resort, where
most of those would come whose means and goodwill would incline
them to works of piety, he resolved to choose the most suitable
site that he could here find.&nbsp; According to some, while
taking counsel with himself and with all who could help him, the
site which we now adore was shown him in a vision; others say
that on walking without the town he was seduced by the angelic
warbling of a bird, and thus ravished to a spot where he found
all things in such order for his design that he settled upon it
then and there.&nbsp; Many hold as true the story of certain
shepherds who about a fortnight earlier than the coming of the
father, heard songs of more than earthly sweetness as they were
keeping watch over their flocks by night.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;But,&rdquo; concludes Fassola, with some naivet&eacute;
considering the reserve he has shown in accepting any of the
foregoing stories, &ldquo;take it in whatever way you will, the
inception of the place was obviously miraculous.&rdquo;</p>

<span class="GutSmall"><i>EARLY HISTORY OF THE SACRO
MONTE</i></span><span class="GutSmall">.</span></h2>
<p><span class="smcap">Whether</span> miraculous or not, the
early history of the Sacro Monte is undoubtedly obscure, and the
reader will probably have ere this perceived that the accounts
given by Fassola and Torrotti stand in some need of
reconstruction.&nbsp; The resemblance between Varallo and
Jerusalem is too far fetched to have had any <i>bon&acirc;
fide</i> effect upon a man of travel and of affairs, such as
Caimi certainly was; it is hardly greater than the famous one
between Monmouth and Macedon; there is, indeed, a river&mdash;not
to say two&mdash;at Varallo, and there is a river also only
twenty-five miles off Jerusalem; doubtless at one time or another
there have been crucifixions in both, but some other reason must
be sought for the establishment of a great spiritual stronghold
at the foot of the Alps, than a mere desire to find the place
which should most remind its founder of the Holy City.&nbsp; Why
this great effort in a remote and then almost inaccessible
province of the Church, far from any of the religious centres
towards which one would have expected it to gravitate?&nbsp; The
answer suggests itself as readily as the question; namely, that
it was an attempt to stem the torrent of reformed doctrines
already surging over many an Alpine pass, and threatening a moral
invasion as fatal to the spiritual power of Rome as earlier
physical invasions of Northmen had been to her material
power.</p>
<p>Those who see the Italian sub-alpine valleys of to-day as
devoted to the Church of Rome are apt to forget how nearly they
fell away from her in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries,
and what efforts, both by way of punishment and allurement, she
was compelled to make before she could retain them in her
grasp.&nbsp; In most of them the ferment caused by the
introduction of the reformed doctrines was in the end stamped
out; but in some, as in the Valle di Poschiavo, and the Val
Bregaglia, Protestantism is still either the predominant creed or
not uncommon.&nbsp; I do not mention the Vaudois valleys of
Piedmont, for I am told these were Protestant before either Huss
or Luther preached.</p>
<p>The Valsesians had ere now given proof of a tendency towards
heresy, but they were a people whom it was worth while making
every effort to retain.&nbsp; They have ever been, as we have
seen it said already, a vigorous, sturdy, independent race,
imbued, in virtue perhaps of their mixed descent, with a large
share of the good points both of Southern and Northern
nations.&nbsp; They are Italians; but Italians of the most robust
and Roman type, combining in a remarkable degree Southern grace
and versatility with Northern enterprise and power of
endurance.&nbsp; It is no great stretch of imagination to suppose
that Bernardino Caimi was alive to dangers that were sufficiently
obvious, and that he began with the Val Sesia, partly as of all
the sub-alpine valleys the one most imbued with German
blood&mdash;the one in which to this day the German language has
lingered longest, and in which, therefore, ideas derived from
Germany would most easily be established&mdash;and partly because
of the quasi-independence of the Val Sesia, and of its lying out
of the path of those wars from which the plains of Lombardy have
been rarely long exempt.&nbsp; It may be noted that the movement
set on foot by Caimi extended afterwards to other places, always,
with the exception of Crea, on the last slopes of the Alps before
the plains of Lombardy and Piedmont begin.&nbsp; Varese, Locarno,
Orta, Varallo, Oropa, Graglia, St. Ignazio, not to mention St.
Giovanni di Andorno, have all of them something of the spiritual
frontier fortress about them, and, I imagine, are all more or
less directly indebted to the reformation for their
inception.</p>
<p>Confining our attention to Varallo, the history of the Sacro
Monte divides itself into two main periods; the first, from the
foundation to the visit of S. Carlo Borromeo in 1678; the second,
from the visit of S. Carlo to the present day.&nbsp; The first of
these periods begins with 1486, in which year the present Sacro
Monte was no doubt formally contemplated, if not actually
commenced.&nbsp; That it was contemplated is shown by the
inscription on Caimi&rsquo;s grave already given, and also by the
first of the two deeds given in Signor Galloni&rsquo;s notes,
from which it appears <a name="citation52"></a><a
href="#footnote52" class="citation">[52]</a> that under the brief
of December 21, 1486, Caimi had powers to take over the land now
covered by the chapels, <i>even though he should be
absent</i>&mdash;it being evidently intended that the land should
be conveyed at once, and before he could return from Jerusalem,
for which place he started in 1487.&nbsp; Moreover, there remains
one small chapel with frescoes that can hardly be later than
1485&ndash;1490.&nbsp; This is now numbered 45, and is supposed
by many to be older even than Caimi&rsquo;s first visit.&nbsp; It
may be so, but there is nothing to show that it actually
was.&nbsp; I have seen a date scratched on it which it is said is
1437, but the four is really a five, which in old writing is
often taken for a four, and the frescoes, which in their own way
are of considerable merit, would be most naturally assigned to
about the date 1485&ndash;1490.&nbsp; I do not think there can be
a doubt that we have in this chapel the earliest existing
building on the Sacro Monte, but find it impossible to form any
opinion as to whether it was in existence before Bernardino
Caimi&rsquo;s time, or no.</p>
<p>In the second of the two deeds given by Signor Galloni (p.
85), the following passage occurs:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Et similiter fecerunt ipsi Sindici, et
Procuratores, ut supr&agrave; introducendo ipsum Patrem Vicarium
ut supr&agrave; in Eremitorium sancti Sepulchri existent. in loco
ubi dicebatur super pariete, aperiendo eidem ostia dicti
Eremitorij, et dando eidem claues Ostiorum dicti eremitorij, et
eum deambulari faciendo in eo, et similiter in Hortis dicti
Eremitorij, dando eidem in gremium ut supr&agrave; de terris,
herbis, et frondibus, et lapidibus existen. in locis
pr&aelig;dictis, <i>et similiter in Capella existente subtus
crucem</i>, <i>et in Capellam Ascensionis &AElig;dificatam super
Monte pr&aelig;dicto</i>.&nbsp; Qui locus est de membris dicti
Monasterii suprascripti.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Neither Signor Galloni, who pointed out this passage to me,
nor I, though we have more than once discussed the matter on the
ground itself, can arrive at any conclusion as to what was
intended by &ldquo;the chapel now in existence under the
cross,&rdquo; nor yet what chapel is intended by &ldquo;the
chapel of the Ascension on the said mountain.&rdquo;&nbsp; It is
probable that there was an early chapel of the Ascension, and the
wooden figure of Christ on the fountain in the piazza before the
church was very likely taken from it, but there is no evidence to
show where it stood.</p>
<p>Signor Arienta tells me that the chapel now occupied by the
Temptation in the Wilderness was formerly a chapel of the
Ascension.&nbsp; He told me to go round to the back of this
chapel, and I should find it was earlier than appeared from the
front.&nbsp; I did so, and saw it had formerly fronted the other
way to what it does now, but among the many dates scrawled on it
could find none earlier than 1506, and it is not likely to have
been built thirteen years before it got scrawled on.</p>
<p>Some hold the chapels referred to in the deed above quoted
from to have included the present Annunciation, Salutation, and
sleeping St. Joseph block&mdash;or part of it.&nbsp; Others hold
them to have referred to the chapels now filled by the
Piet&agrave; and the Entombment (Nos. 40 and 41); but it should
not be forgotten that by 1493 the chapels of S. Francis and the
Holy Sepulchre were already in existence, though no mention is
made of them; and there may have been other chapels also already
built of which no mention is made.&nbsp; Thus immediately outside
the St. Francis chapel and towards the door leading to the Holy
Sepulchre, there is a small recess in which is placed an urn of
iron that contains the head of Bernardino Caimi with a Latin
inscription; and hard by there is another inscription which runs
as follows:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Magnificus D. Milanus Scarrogninus hoc
Sepulcrum cum fabrica sibi contigua Christo posuit die septimo
Octobris MCCCCLXXXXI.&nbsp; R. P. Frater Bernardinus de Mediolano
Ordinis Minorum de Observ. sacra hujus montis excogitavit loca,
ut hic Hierusalem videat qui peragrare nequit.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We may say with some confidence that the present chapel No.
45, those numbered 40 and 41, the block containing the St.
Francis and Holy Sepulchre chapels, and probably the Presepio,
Adoration of the Shepherds, and Circumcision chapels&mdash;though
it may be doubted whether these last contained the figures that
they now do&mdash;were in existence before the year 1500.&nbsp;
Part if not all of the block containing the Sta. Casa di Loreto,
in which the Annunciation is now found, is also probably earlier
than 1500, as also an early Agony in the Garden now long
destroyed, but of which we are told that the figures were
originally made of wood.&nbsp; Over and above these there was a
Cena, Capture, Flagellation, and an Ascension chapel, all of
which contained wooden figures, and cannot be dated later than
the three or four earliest years of the sixteenth century.&nbsp;
No wooden figure is to be dated later than this, for when once an
oven for baking clay had been made (and this must have been done
soon after Gaudenzio took the works on the Sacro Monte in hand)
the use of wood was discarded never to be resumed.</p>
<p>According to both Fassola and Torrotti, the first chapel
erected on the Sacro Monte was that of S. Francesco, with its
adjacent reproduction of the Holy Sepulchre.&nbsp; According to
Bordiga the first was the entombment, containing nine figures of
wood, or, as the earlier writers say, eight.&nbsp; Bordiga
probably means that the Entombment was the earliest chapel with
figures in it, and the other writers that the St. Francis chapel
was the first in which mass was said.&nbsp; These last speak very
highly of the wooden figures in the Entombment chapel, and so
more guardedly does Bordiga.&nbsp; I will return to them when I
come to the present group of nine by Luigi Marchesi, a sculptor
of Saltrio, which were substituted for the old ones in
1826.&nbsp; The early writers say that there was no fresco
background to this chapel, and this suggests that the attempt to
combine sculpture and painting was not part of the initial
scheme, though soon engrafted on to it, inasmuch as this is the
only chapel about which I find it expressly stated by early
writers that it was without a fresco background (&ldquo;senza
pittura alcuna&rdquo;). <a name="citation57"></a><a
href="#footnote57" class="citation">[57]</a>&nbsp; Though there
was no fresco background, Bordiga says there was a fresco
painted, doubtless done very early in his career, by Gaudenzio
Ferrari, outside the chapel just above the iron grating through
which the visitor must look.&nbsp; Probably the original scheme
was to have sculptured figures inside the chapels, and frescoes
outside; by an easy modification these last were transferred from
the outside to the inside, and so designed as to form an integral
part of the composition: the daring scheme of combining the
utmost resources of both painting and sculpture in a single work
was thus gradually evolved rather than arrived at <i>per
saltum</i>.&nbsp; Assuming, however, the currently received date
of 1503 or 1504 as correct for Gaudenzio&rsquo;s frescoes in the
present Piet&agrave; chapel, the conception as carried out in the
greater number of the existing chapels had then attained the
shape from which no subsequent departure was made.</p>
<p>Returning to Gaudenzio&rsquo;s fresco outside the S. Francesco
chapel, Bordiga says that Caccia gave the following lines on this
work:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Sotto un vicino portico di fuore<br />
Portato a sepelir &egrave; di pittura<br />
Un Cristo; che non mai Zeuxi pittore<br />
Di questo finse piu bella figura,<br />
Che un San Francesco possa pareggiare,<br />
Pinto pi&ugrave; inanzi sopra d&rsquo;un altare.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The reader will note that the fresco is here expressly stated
to be &ldquo;di fuore&rdquo; or outside and not inside the
chapel.</p>
<p>Both Fassola and Torrotti place this fresco on the outside
wall of the chapel of St. Francis, but Bordiga is probably right
in saying it was on the Entombment chapel.&nbsp; No trace of it
remains, nor yet of the other works by Gaudenzio, which all three
writers agree were in the S. Francesco chapel, though they must
all have been some few years later than the chapel itself.&nbsp;
These consisted of portraits of Milano Scarrognini with Father
Beato Candido Ranzo Bernardino Caimi upon the gospel, or right,
side of the altar, and of Scarrognini&rsquo;s wife and son with
Bernardino Caimi, on the epistle side.&nbsp; According to
Bordiga, Gaudenzio also painted a St. Anthony of Padua, and a St.
Helena, one on either side the grating.&nbsp; Inside the chapel
over the altar was a painting of St. Francis receiving the
stigmata, also by Gaudenzio.&nbsp; This is the only one of his
works in or about the S. Francesco chapel which still exists; it
is now in the pinacoteca of the Museum at Varallo, but is not, so
far as I could judge of it, one of his best pictures.&nbsp; The
other works were in a decayed condition in 1703, when they were
removed, and the chapel was redecorated by Francesco Leva, a
painter of Milan.</p>
<p>The Crucifixion chapel of Gaudenzio Ferrari was begun and
finished between 1520 and 1530.&nbsp; I have found three
excellently written dates of 1529 scrawled upon the fresco
background.&nbsp; One of them, &ldquo;1529 Die 26 Octobre
Johannes Antoninus,&rdquo; is especially clear, and the other two
leave no doubt what year was intended.&nbsp; I have found no
earlier date, but should not be surprised if further search were
more successful.&nbsp; I may say in passing that it seemed to me
as though some parts of the scar made by the inscription had been
filled with paint, while others had certainly not&mdash;as though
the work had been in parts retouched, not so very long ago.&nbsp;
I think this is so, but two or three to whom I showed what I took
to be the new colour were not convinced, so I must leave others
to decide the point.</p>
<p>The Magi chapel must be assigned to some date between the
years 1530 and 1539&mdash;I should say probably to about 1538,
but I will return to this later on.&nbsp; Torrotti says that some
of the figures on the Christ taken for the last time before
Pilate (chapel No. 32) are by Gaudenzio, as also some paintings
that were preserved when the Palazzo di Pilato was built, but I
can see no sign of either one or the other now; nevertheless it
is likely enough that several figures&mdash;transformed as we
shall presently see that d&rsquo;Enrico or his assistants knew
very well how to transform them&mdash;are doing duty in the
Caiaphas, Herod, Pilate, and Ecce Homo chapels.&nbsp; So
cunningly did the workmen of that time disguise a figure when
they wanted to alter its character and action that it would be no
easy matter to find out exactly what was done; if they could turn
an Eve, as they did, into a very passable Roman soldier assisting
at the capture of Christ, they could make anything out of
anything.&nbsp; A figure was a figure, and was not to be thrown
away lightly.</p>
<p>Soon after the completion of the Magi chapel the work flagged
in consequence of the wars then devastating the provinces of
North Italy; nevertheless by the middle of the sixteenth century
we learn from Torrotti that some nineteen chapels had been
completed.</p>
<p>It is idle to spend much time in guessing which these chapels
were, when Caccia&rsquo;s work, published in 1565, is sure to be
found some day and will settle the matter authoritatively, but
the reader will not be far wrong if he sees the Sacro Monte by
the year 1550 as consisting of the following chapels: Adam and
Eve, Annunciation, Salutation (?), Magi, Adoration of the Infant
Jesus by the Shepherds, Adoration by Joseph and Mary,
Circumcision, (but not the present figures nor fresco
background), Last Supper, Agony in the Garden, Capture,
Flagellation, Crowning with thorns (?), Christ taken for the last
time before Pilate, the Original journey to Calvary, Fainting
Madonna, Crucifixion, Entombment, Ascension, and the old church
of the Assumption of the Virgin Mary now removed.&nbsp; There
were probably one or two others, but there cannot have been
many.</p>
<p>In the 1586 edition of Caccia, a MS. copy of which I have
before me, the chapels are given as follows: Adam and Eve,
Annunciation, and Santa Casa di Loreto, Visit of Mary to
Elizabeth, Magi, Joseph and Mary worshipping the Infant Christ,
and the Adoration of Shepherds, <a name="citation62"></a><a
href="#footnote62" class="citation">[62]</a> Circumcision, Joseph
warned to fly, the chapel (but not the figures) of the Massacre
of the Innocents, Flight into Egypt Baptism, Temptation in the
Wilderness, Woman of Samaria, the chapel (but not the figures) of
the Healing of the Paralytic, and the Raising of the
Widow&rsquo;s son at Nain, the Raising of Lazarus, Entry of
Christ into Jerusalem, the Last Supper, Agony in the Garden,
Capture, Flagellation, Crowning with Thorns, Christ carrying His
cross to Calvary (doubtless Tabachetti&rsquo;s chapel), the
Fainting of the Virgin, the earlier Journey to Calvary by
Gaudenzio (now dispersed or destroyed), Crucifixion,
Piet&agrave;, Holy Sepulchre, Appearance to Mary Magdalene (now
no longer existing).</p>
<p>I should say, however, that I find it impossible to reconcile
the two accounts of the journeys to Calvary, given in the prose
introduction to this work, and in the poetical description that
follows it, or rather to understand the topography of the
poetical version at all, for the prose account is plain
enough.&nbsp; I shall place a MS. copy of the 1586 edition of
Caccia&rsquo;s book in the British Museum, before this present
volume is published, and will leave other students of Valsesian
history to be more fortunate if they can.&nbsp; Poetical
descriptions are so far better than prose, inasmuch as there is
generally less of them in a page, but on the whole prose has the
advantage.</p>
<p>It would be interesting to see the 1565 and 1576 editions of
Caccia, and note the changes and additions that can be found in
them.&nbsp; The differences between the 1586 and 1590 editions
(dated 1587 and 1591&mdash;the preface to the second being dated
September 25, 1589), are enough to throw considerable additional
light upon the history of the place, and if, as I believe likely,
we find no mention of Tabachetti&rsquo;s Calvary chapel in the
edition of 1576, nor of his other chapels, we should be able to
date his arrival at Varallo within a very few years, and settle a
question which, until these two editions of Caccia are found,
appears insoluble.&nbsp; I must be myself content with pointing
out these <i>libri desiderati</i> to the future historian.</p>
<p>Some say that the work on the Sacro Monte was almost
discontinued between the years 1540 and 1580.&nbsp; I cannot,
however, find that this was so, though it appears to have
somewhat flagged.&nbsp; I cannot tell whether Tabachetti came to
Varallo before S. Carlo or after him.&nbsp; If before, then a
good deal of the second impetus may be due to the sculptor rather
than to the saint; if after, and as a consequence of S.
Carlo&rsquo;s visit, then indeed S. Carlo must be considered as
the second founder of the place; but whatever view is taken about
this, S. Carlo&rsquo;s visit in 1578 is convenient as marking a
new departure in the history of the Sacro Monte, and he may be
fairly called its second founder.</p>
<p>Giussano gives the following account of his first visit, which
makes us better understand the austere expression that reigns on
S. Carlo&rsquo;s face, as we see it represented in his
portraits:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;It was two o&rsquo;clock in the day before
St. Charles arrived at this place, and he had not broken his
fast, but before taking anything he visited the different chapels
for meditation, of which Father Adorno gave him the points.&nbsp;
As evening drew on, he withdrew to take his refection of bread
and water, and then returned again to the chapels till after
midnight though the weather was very cold&rdquo; [end of October
or beginning of November].&nbsp; &ldquo;He then took two
hours&rsquo; rest on a chair, and at five o&rsquo;clock in the
morning resumed his devotions; then, after having said his Mass,
he again allowed himself a small portion of bread and water, and
continued his journey to Milan, renewed in fervour of spirit, and
with a firm determination to begin again to serve God with
greater energy than ever.&rdquo; <a name="citation65"></a><a
href="#footnote65" class="citation">[65]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Surely one may add &ldquo;according to his lights&rdquo; after
the words &ldquo;to serve God.&rdquo;&nbsp; The second visit of
St. Charles to Varallo, a few days before his death, is even more
painful reading, and the reader may be referred for an account of
it to chapter xi. of the second volume of the work last quoted
from.&nbsp; He had a cell in the cloister, where he slept on a
wooden bed, which is still shown and venerated, and used to spend
hours in contemplating the various sacred mysteries, but most
especially the Agony in the Garden, near which a little shelter
was made for him, and in which he was praying when his impending
death was announced to him by an angel.&nbsp; But this chapel,
which was near the present Transfiguration Chapel, was destroyed
and rebuilt on its present site after his death, as also the Cena
Chapel, which originally contained frescoes by Bernardino
Lanini.&nbsp; It was on the Sacro Monte that S. Carlo discharged
his last public functions, after which, feeling that he had taken
a chill, he left Varallo on the 29th of October 1584, and died at
Milan six days afterwards.</p>
<p>At S. Carlo&rsquo;s instance Pellegrino Pellegrini, called
Tibaldi, made a new design for the Sacro Monte, which was happily
never carried out, but which I am told involved the destruction
of many of the earlier chapels.&nbsp; He made the plan of the
Sacro Monte as it stood in his time, which I have already
referred to, and designed the many chapels mentioned in the 1586
edition of Caccia as about to be built.&nbsp; Prominent among
these was the Temple of Solomon, which was to involve
&ldquo;<i>una spesa grandissima</i>,&rdquo; and was to be as like
the real temple as it could be made.&nbsp; Inside it were to be
groups of figures representing Christ driving out those that
bought and sold, and it was to have a magnificent marble
portico.</p>
<p>The Palazzo di Pilato, which, as the name denotes, is devoted
to the sufferings of Christ under Pontius Pilate, was actually
carried out, though not till some years after S. Carlo&rsquo;s
death, and not according to Pellegrini&rsquo;s design.&nbsp; It
is most probable that the designer of the Palazzo di Pilato, and
of the Caiaphas and Herod chapels as we now see them, was
Giovanni d&rsquo;Enrico.&nbsp; &ldquo;It was in 1608,&rdquo; says
Bordiga, <a name="citation66"></a><a href="#footnote66"
class="citation">[66]</a> writing of the Santa Scala, which leads
from the Crowning with Thorns to the Ecce Homo chapels, and
which, one would say, must have been one of the first things done
when the Palazzo di Pilato was made, &ldquo;that this work with
its steps, exactly twenty-eight in number, was begun, according
to the design obtained from Rome by Francesco Testa, who was then
Fabbriciere.&nbsp; This is for the information of those who think
it is the work of Pellegrini.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Between this year and 1645 the four Pilate chapels, the Ecce
Homo, Caiaphas, Herod, present Piet&agrave;, Sleeping Apostles,
Agony in the Garden, and Christ Nailed to the Cross chapels were
either created or reconstructed.&nbsp; These works bear
d&rsquo;Enrico&rsquo;s name in the guide-books, and he no doubt
presided over the work that was done in them; but I should say
that by far the greater number of the figures in them are by
Giacomo Ferro, his assistant, to whom I will return presently, or
by other pupils and assistants.&nbsp; Only one chapel, the
Transfiguration, belongs to the second half of the seventeenth
century, and one, the Christ before Annas, to the eighteenth
(1765); one&mdash;the present Entombment&mdash;belongs to the
nineteenth, and one or two have been destroyed, as has been
unfortunately the case with the Chiesa Vecchia; but the plan of
the Sacro Monte in 1671, which I here give, will show that it was
not much different then from what it is at present.&nbsp; The

69</span>CHAPTER VI.<br />
<span class="GutSmall"><i>PRELIMINARY
CONSIDERATIONS</i></span><span class="GutSmall">.</span></h2>
<p><span class="smcap">The</span> foregoing outline of the
history of the work must suffice for the present.&nbsp; I will
reserve further remarks for the space which I will devote to each
individual chapel.&nbsp; As regards the particular form the work
took, I own that I have been at times inclined to wonder whether
Leonardo da Vinci may not have had something to do with it.</p>
<p>Between 1481 and the end of 1499 he was in Milan, and during
the later years of this period was the chief authority on all art
matters.&nbsp; It is not easy to think that Caimi, who was a
Milanese, would not consult him before embarking upon an art
enterprise of the first magnitude; and certainly there is a
something in the idea of turning the full strength of both
painting and sculpture at once on to a single subject, which
harmonises well with the magnificent rashness of which we know
Leonardo to have been capable, and with the fact that he was both
a painter and a sculptor himself.&nbsp; There is, however, not
one scrap of evidence in support of this view, which is based
solely on the fact that both the scheme and Leonardo were
audacious, and that the first is little likely to have been
undertaken without counsel from the second.&nbsp; The actual
evidence points rather, as already indicated, in the direction of
thinking that the frescoes began outside the chapels, got inside
them for shelter, and ere long claimed the premises as belonging
no less to themselves than to the statues.&nbsp; The idea of
treating full-relief sculptured figures with a view to a
pictorial rather than sculpturesque effect was in itself, as
undertaken when Gaudenzio was too young to have had a voice in
the matter, a daring innovation, even without the adjunct of a
fresco background; and the idea of taking a mountain as though it
were a book, and illustrating it with a number of such groups,
was more daring still.&nbsp; To this extent we may perhaps
suppose Caimi to have been indebted to Leonardo da Vinci: the
rest is probably due to Gaudenzio, who evolved it in the course
of those unforeseen developments of which design and judgment are
never slow to take advantage.</p>
<p>To whomsoever the conception may be due, if it had only been
carried out by such artists as Tabachetti and Gaudenzio Ferrari,
or even Giovanni d&rsquo;Enrico, to say nothing of Bargnola or
Rossetti, (to whichever of the two the Massacre of the Innocents
must be assigned,) works like those at Varallo might have been
repeated, as indeed they sometimes were, thenceforward to the
present day.&nbsp; Unfortunately the same thing was attempted at
Orta, and later on at Varese, by greatly inferior men.&nbsp; It
is true that some of the groups at Varese, especially the one in
the Disputa Chapel, are exceedingly fine, and that there are few
chapels even there in which no good or even admirable figures may
be found.&nbsp; Still the prevailing spirit at Varese is stagey;
the work belongs to an age when art of all kinds was held to
consist mainly in exaggeration, and when freedom from affectation
had fallen into a disrepute from which it has taken centuries to
emerge.&nbsp; Nevertheless the work at Varese is for the most
part able; if at times somewhat boisterous and ranting, it is
incomparably above the feeble, silly cant of Orta; but
unfortunately it is by Orta that English people for the most part
judge the attempt to combine sculpture and painting.&nbsp; It is
indeed some years since I was at this last-named place, and
remembering how long I knew the Sacro Monte at Varallo without
observing the Vecchietto in the Descent from the Cross Chapel, I
cannot be sure that there is not some more interesting work at
Orta than I now know.&nbsp; I do not think, however, I am far
wrong in saying that the chapels at Orta are for the most part
exceedingly bad.</p>
<p>So are some even at Varallo itself, but assuredly not most of
them.&nbsp; One&mdash;I mean, of course, Tabachetti&rsquo;s
Journey to Calvary, which contains about forty figures rather
larger than life, and nine horses,&mdash;is of such superlative
excellence as regards composition and dramatic power, to say
nothing of the many admirable individual figures comprised in it,
that it is not too much to call it the most astounding work that
has ever been achieved in sculpture.&nbsp; I know that this is
strong language, but have considered my words as much as I care
to do.&nbsp; As Michael Angelo&rsquo;s Medicean Chapel errs on
the side of over-subtlety, refinement, and the exaggerated
idealism from which indeed there is but one step to the
<i>barocco</i>, so does Tabachetti&rsquo;s on that of
over-downrightness, or, as a critic with a cultivated eye might
say, with perhaps a show of reason at a first glance, even of
vulgarity.&nbsp; Nevertheless, if I could have my choice whether
to have created Michael Angelo&rsquo;s chapel or
Tabachetti&rsquo;s, I should not for a moment hesitate about
choosing Tabachetti&rsquo;s, though it drove its unhappy creator
mad, which the Medicean chapel never did by Michael Angelo.&nbsp;
Three other chapels by Tabachetti are also admirable works.&nbsp;
Two chapels contain very extensive frescoes by Gaudenzio Ferrari,
than which it is safe to say that no finer works of their kind
have been preserved to us.&nbsp; The statues by Gaudenzio in the
same chapels are all interesting, and some remarkably good.&nbsp;
Their arrangement in the Crucifixion Chapel, if not marked by the
superlative dramatic power of Tabachetti, is still solemn,
dignified, and impressive.&nbsp; The frescoes by Morazzone in
Tabachetti&rsquo;s great chapel belong to the decline of art, but
there is still much in them that is excellent.&nbsp; So there is
in some of those by Tanzio and Melchiorre, Giovanni
d&rsquo;Enrico&rsquo;s brothers.&nbsp; Giovanni
d&rsquo;Enrico&rsquo;s Nailing of Christ to the Cross, with its
sixty figures all rather larger than life, challenges a
comparison with Tabachetti&rsquo;s, which it will not bear; still
it is a great work.&nbsp; So are several of his other
chapels.&nbsp; I am not so thoroughly in sympathy with the work
of any of the three brothers d&rsquo;Enrico as I should like to
be, but they cannot be ignored or spoken of without
respect.&nbsp; There are excellent figures in some of the chapels
by less well-known men; and lastly, there is the Vecchietto,
perhaps the finest figure of all, who looks as if he had dropped
straight from the heavens towards which he is steadfastly
regarding, and of whom nothing is known except that, if not by
Tabachetti, he must be by a genius in some respects even more
commanding, who has left us nothing save this Melchizedek of a
figure, without father, mother, or descent.</p>
<p>I have glanced at some of the wealth in store for those who
will explore it, but at the same time I cannot pretend that even
the greater number of the chapels on the Sacro Monte are above
criticism; and unfortunately some of the best do not come till
the visitor, if he takes them in the prescribed order, has
already seen a good many, and is beginning to be tired.&nbsp;
There is not a little to be said in favour of taking them in the
reverse order.&nbsp; As when one has sampled several figures in a
chapel and found them commonplace, one is apt to overlook a good
one which may have got in by accident of shifting in some one of
the several rearrangements made in the course of more than three
centuries, so when sampling the chapels themselves, after finding
half a dozen running which are of inferior merit, we approach the
others with a bias against them.&nbsp; Moreover, all of them have
suffered more or less severely from decay.&nbsp; Rain and snow,
indeed, can hardly get right inside the chapels, or, at any rate,
not inside most of them, but they are all open to the air, and,
at a height of over two thousand feet, ages of winter damp have
dimmed the glory even of the best-preserved.&nbsp; In many cases
the hair and beards, with excess of realism, were made of horse
hair glued on, and the glue now shows unpleasantly; while the
paint on many of the faces and dresses has blistered or peeled,
leaving the figures with a diseased and mangy look.&nbsp; In
other cases, they have been scraped and repainted, and this
process has probably been repeated many times over, with
inevitable loss of character; for the paint, unless very
carefully removed, must soon clog up and conceal delicate
modelling in many parts of the face and hands.&nbsp; The new
paint has often been of a shiny, oleaginous character, and this
will go far to vulgarise even a finely modelled figure, giving it
something of the look of a Highlander outside a
tobacconist&rsquo;s shop.&nbsp; I am glad to see that Professor
Burlazzi, in repainting the Adam and Eve in the first chapel, has
used dead colour, as was done by Tabachetti in his Journey to
Calvary.&nbsp; As the figures have often become mangy, so the
frescoes are with few exceptions injured by damp and mould.&nbsp;
The expense of keeping up so many chapels must be very heavy; it
is surprising, therefore, that the general state of repair should
be as good as it is.&nbsp; Nevertheless, there is not a chapel
which does not require some effort of the imagination before the
mind&rsquo;s eye can see it as it was when left by those who made
it.</p>
<p>Unless the reader feels equal to this effort,&mdash;and enough
remains to make it a very possible one&mdash;he had better stick
to the Royal Academy and Grosvenor Exhibitions.&nbsp; It should
go without saying that a work of art, if considered at all, must
be held to be as it was when first completed.&nbsp; If we could
see Gaudenzio Ferrari&rsquo;s Crucifixion Chapel with its
marvellous frescoes as strong and fresh in colour as they were
three centuries and a half ago, and with its nearly thirty
life-sized human figures and horses in good condition&mdash;not
forgetting that, whatever Sir Henry Layard may say to the
contrary, they are all by one hand; if, again, Tabachetti&rsquo;s
great work was seen by us as it was seen by Tabachetti, and
Morazzone&rsquo;s really fine background were not disfigured by
damp and mildew, it can hardly be doubted that even &ldquo;a
cultivated eye&rdquo; would find little difficulty in seeing
these two chapels as among the very finest triumphs that have
been vouchsafed to human genius; and surely, if this be so, it
follows that we should rate them no lower even now.&nbsp;
Gaudenzio Ferrari&rsquo;s Crucifixion Chapel, regarded as a
single work, conceived and executed by a single artist, who aimed
with one intention at the highest points ever attained both by
painting and sculpture, and who wielded on a very large scale, in
connection with what was then held to be the sublimest and most
solemn of conceivable subjects, the fullest range of all the
resources available by either, must stand as perhaps the most
daringly ambitious attempt that has been made in the history of
art.&nbsp; As regards the frescoes, the success was as signal as
the daring; and even as regards the sculpture, the work cannot be
said to have failed.&nbsp; Gaudenzio the sculptor will not indeed
compare with Gaudenzio the painter; still less will he compare
with Tabachetti either as a modeller or composer of full-relief
figures; but Tabachetti did not paint his own background as well
as make his figures, and something must always be allowed to
those who are carrying double.&nbsp; Moreover, Tabachetti
followed, whereas Gaudenzio led as pioneer in a realm of art
never hitherto attempted.&nbsp; Nevertheless, I may be allowed to
say that, notwithstanding all Gaudenzio&rsquo;s greatness, I find
Tabachetti the strongest and most robust of all the great men who
have left their mark on the Sacro Monte at Varallo.</p>
<p>We cannot dismiss such works with cheap commonplaces about
Madame Tussaud&rsquo;s&mdash;and for aught I know there may be
some very good stuff at Madame Tussaud&rsquo;s&mdash;or sneer at
them as though they must be all much of a muchness, and because
the Orta chapels are bad, therefore those at Varallo must be so
also.&nbsp; Those who confine themselves to retailing what they
take to be art-tips gathered from our leading journals of
culture, will probably continue to trade on this not very hardly
earned capital, whatever may be urged upon the other side; but
those who will take the trouble involved in forming an
independent judgment may be encouraged to make investment of
their effort here by remembering that Gaudenzio Ferrari ranks as
among the few purest and most accomplished artists of the very
culminating period of Italian art, and that what he thought good
enough to do may be well worth our while to consider with the
best attention we can give to it.</p>
<p>Another point should not be forgotten by those who would form
their opinion intelligently.&nbsp; I mean, that they are
approaching a class of work with which they are unfamiliar, and
must not, therefore, expect to be able to make up their minds
about it as they might if the question were one either of
painting or sculpture only.&nbsp; Sculpture and painting are here
integral parts of a single design, and it is some little time
before we grasp this conception so fully to be able to balance
duly the merits and demerits of different compositions, even
though we eventually get to see that there is an immeasurable
distance between the best and worst.&nbsp; I now know, for
example, that Tabachetti&rsquo;s Journey to Calvary is greatly
finer than Giovanni d&rsquo;Enrico&rsquo;s Nailing to the
Cross.&nbsp; I see this so clearly that I find it difficult to
conceive how I can have doubted about it.&nbsp; At the same time,
I can remember thinking that one was nearly as good as the other,
and this long after I should have found little difficulty in
making up my mind about less complex works.</p>

80</span>CHAPTER VII.<br />
<span class="GutSmall"><i>AIM AND SCOPE OF THE SACRO
MONTE</i></span><span class="GutSmall">.</span></h2>
<p><span class="smcap">The</span> difficulty referred to at the
close of the last chapter is the same as that which those who
rarely go to a theatre have to get over before they can
appreciate an actor.&nbsp; They go to &ldquo;Macbeth&rdquo; or
&ldquo;Othello,&rdquo; expecting to find players speaking and
acting on the stage much as they would in actual life; and not
finding this, are apt to think the acting coarse and
unnatural.&nbsp; They forget that the physical conditions of the
stage involve compliance with conventions from which there is no
escape, and expect the players to play a game which the players
themselves know to be impossible, and are not even trying to
play.&nbsp; So important is it to understand the standpoint from
which the artists at Varallo worked, that I shall venture some
further remarks upon their aim and scope before going on to the
works themselves.</p>
<p>Their object, or the object of those who commissioned them,
was to bring the scene with which they were engaged home to the
spectator in all its fulness, short of actual life and motion;
but in this &ldquo;short of actual life and motion&rdquo; what a
cutting-out of the part of Hamlet is there not involved.&nbsp; We
can spare a good deal of Hamlet; but if the part is totally
excised,&mdash;even though the Hamlet be Mr. Irving
himself,&mdash;the play must suffer.&nbsp; To try to represent
action without the immediate changes of position and expression
which are its most essential features, seems like courting
defeat, and to a certain extent defeat does invariably follow the
attempt to treat very violent rapid action except loosely and
sketchily.&nbsp; Violent action carried to high degree of finish
is hardly ever successful in painting or sculpture; a crowd done
in Michael Angelo&rsquo;s Medici chapel manner must inevitably
fail, and if a crowd is to be treated in sculpture at all,
Tabachetti&rsquo;s broad, large-brushed, and somewhat sketchy
treatment is the one most to be preferred.&nbsp; In spite,
however, of the incomparable success of Tabachetti&rsquo;s work,
I am tempted to question whether quiet and reposeful sculpture is
not always most permanently pleasing, as not involving so
peremptory a demand for the change that cannot, of course,
ensue.&nbsp; At any rate, as one lie generally leads to others,
so with the attempt to render action without action&rsquo;s most
essential characteristic, there is a departure from realism which
involves a host of other departures if the error is to be
distributed so as to avoid offence.&nbsp; In other words,
convention, or a composition between artist and spectator,
whereby, in view of admitted bankruptcy and failure of possible
payment in full, a less thing shall be taken as a greater, has
superseded nature at a very early point in the proceedings.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, within the limits of the composition we expect
to be paid in full; whatever the dividend is we are to have all
of it, and we sometimes take a different view of the terms of the
settlement to that taken by those with whom we are dealing.&nbsp;
It being admitted that the object of the Sacro Monte workmen was
to bring a scene home to the spectator in all possible fulness,
we expect to have a quotum of our own ideas of the scene,
whatever they may be, put before us, and are more or less
offended when we find a composition which we consider to be
unreal even within its own covenanted limitations.&nbsp; The
fault, however, rests greatly with ourselves, in forgetting that
it must be the ideal of medieval Italians and not our own that we
should look for, and that their ideas concerning the chief actors
in the sacred dramas were not as ours are.&nbsp; For us, the
&omicron;&#7989;&omicron;&iota; &nu;&#8058;&nu;
&beta;&rho;&#8057;&tau;&omicron;&iota;
&epsilon;&#7988;&sigma;&iota; view of history has been gathered
to its fathers, and &omicron;&#7989;&omicron;&iota;
&delta;&#8052; &beta;&rho;&#8057;&tau;&omicron;&iota;
&#7972;&sigma;&alpha;&nu; is reigning in its stead.&nbsp; We
believe that we have advanced upon, not degenerated from our
ancestors, except here and there as by way of back eddy, but
Italians in the Middle Ages may be excused for having been
overawed by the remains of the old splendour which met them
everywhere; and even if this had not been so, to children and
half-educated people that which happened long ago is always
grander and larger than any like thing that happened
recently.&nbsp; As regards the sacred dramas this grandioseness
of conception extended even to the villains of the piece, who
must be greater, more muscular, thorough-going, unredeemed
villains than any now existing.&nbsp; The realism which would
have proved so touching and grateful now&mdash;for we should have
found it turned into idealism through the impress of that seal
which it is time&rsquo;s glory to set upon aged
things&mdash;would in the Middle Ages have seemed as unworthy,
and as much below the dignity of the subject as modern treatment
of the same subjects, with modern costumes, would seem to
ourselves.</p>
<p>Ages thwart and play at cross purposes with one another, as
parents do with children; and our forefathers have been at
infinite trouble and expense to give us what we do not want, and
have withheld what they might have given with very little
trouble, and we should have held as priceless.&nbsp; We cannot
help it; it always has been and always will be so.&nbsp; <i>Omne
ignotum pro magnifico</i> is a condition of existence or at any
rate of progress, and the unknown of the past takes a splendour
reflected from that of the future.&nbsp; The artists and public
of the sixteenth century could no more find what they deemed a
worthy ideal in their own familiar, and as it seemed to them
prosaic age than we in ours, and every age must make its art work
to its own liking and not to that of other people.&nbsp; Caimi
was thinking mainly of his own generation; he could not wait a
couple of hundred years or so till the work should become
touching and quaint through age; he wanted it to be effective
then and there, which if the Apostles were shown as mere common
peasants and fishermen of the then present day, it would not and
could not be&mdash;not at any rate with the pit, and it was to
the pit as well as to the boxes that these pieces were being
played.&nbsp; Let the ablest sculptors of the present time be
asked to treat sacred subjects as was attempted at Varallo, with
the condition that they must keep closely to the costume of
to-day, and they would probably one and all of them decline the
task.&nbsp; We know very well that, laugh at it as we may, our
costume will three hundred years hence be as interesting as that
of any other age, but that is not to the point: it has got to be
effective now, whereas our familiarity with it has bred
contempt.</p>
<p>In the earlier ages both of painting and sculpture these
considerations, obvious as they are, were not taken into
account.&nbsp; The first artists during the medieval revival of
art rose as little to theory as children do.&nbsp; They found the
mere doing at all so difficult that they were at the mercy in
great measure of what they could get.&nbsp; The real was as much
as, and more than, they could manage, and they would have
idealised long before they did, if they had not felt the task too
much for them.&nbsp; They could, with infinite trouble, they
hardly knew how, save themselves yet so as by fire and get a head
or figure of some sort that was not quite unlike what it was
meant for, but they could only do this by helping their
unpractised memories to the facts morsel by morsel, treating
nature as though she were a stuffed set piece, getting her to sit
as still for as long a time as she could be persuaded to do, and
then going all over her touch for touch with a brush like the
point of a pin.&nbsp; If the early masters had been able to do
all they would have liked to have done, no doubt they would most
of them have been as vulgar as we are; fortunately their
incompetence stood them in good stead and saved them from
becoming the Guidos, Domenichinos, and Guercinos, that so many of
their more competent successors took so much trouble to
become.&nbsp; Incompetence, if amiable and painstaking, will have
with it an unconscious involuntary idealism of its own which is
perhaps more charming than any that can be attained by aiming at
it deliberately; at any rate it will take the thing portrayed
apart from the everyday familiar routine of life which is the
great enemy of fancy and the ideal; but the artists of the Sacro
Monte had got far beyond the point at which incompetence could be
of much use to them, and had to find some other means whereby to
steer clear of the everyday life which to the public for whom
they had to play, would have appeared so vulgar, and to us so
infinitely more delightful than much that they have actually left
us.&nbsp; These means they could only find in much the same
quarters as dramatic writers and players find them on the stage,
and to a certain extent no doubt the Varallo chapels, like all
other attempts to place a scene upon a stage, must submit to the
charge of being more or less stagey, but&mdash;more especially
considering that they are seen by daylight,&mdash;it is
surprising how little stagey they are.</p>
<p>Also, like all other attempts to place a scene upon the stage,
they will be found to consist of a few stars, several players of
secondary importance, and a certain number of supers.&nbsp; It is
a mistake to attempt, as I am told is attempted at the
<i>Com&eacute;die Fran&ccedil;aise</i>, to have all the actors of
first-class merit.&nbsp; They kill one another even in a picture,
and on the whole in any work of art it is better to concentrate
the main interest on a sufficient number of the most important
figures, and to let the setting off of these be the chief
business of the remainder.&nbsp; Gaudenzio Ferrari hardly
understood this at all, and has no figures which can be
considered as mere stage accessories.&nbsp; Tabachetti understood
it, but could hardly bring himself down to the level of his
supers.&nbsp; D&rsquo;Enrico understood it perhaps a shade too
well; he was a man of business as well as of very considerable
genius, and turned his supers over to Giacomo Ferro, who might be
trusted to keep them sufficiently commonplace to show his own
work to advantage.&nbsp; It must be owned, however, that the
greater number of D&rsquo;Enrico&rsquo;s chapels would be better
if there had been a little more D&rsquo;Enrico in them and less
Giacomo Ferro, and if the D&rsquo;Enrico had been always taking
pains.</p>
<p>We, of course, should have preferred the figures in the
Varallo chapels to be all of them as realistic as the artist
could make them, provided he chose good types, as a good man may
be very well trusted to do.&nbsp; Whenever we get a bit of
realism as in the Eve, and Sleeping St. Joseph of Tabachetti, in
the Herod, laughing boys, and Caiaphas of D&rsquo;Enrico, and
still more in the Vecchietto, or in the three or four of the
figures in the St. Eusebius Chapel at Crea, we accept it with
avidity, and we may be sure that the masters who gave us the
figures above-named could have given us any number equally
realistic if they had been inclined to do so.&nbsp;
Tabachetti&rsquo;s instinct was certainly towards realism as far
as he dared, but even he is not in most cases
realistic&mdash;not, I mean, in the sense of making his
personages actual life-like portraits.&nbsp; That he was not more
so than he is is probably due to some of the considerations on
which I have above imperfectly dwelt, and to others that have
escaped myself, but were patent enough to him.</p>
<p>One other practical consideration would make against realism
in such works as those at Varallo, I mean the fact that if the
figures were to be portraits of the Varallo celebrities of the
time, the whole place would have been set by the ears in the
competition as to who was to be represented and with what
precedence.&nbsp; It was only by passing a kind of self-denying
ordinance and forbidding portraiture at all that the work could
be carried out.&nbsp; Here and there, as in the case of
Tabachetti&rsquo;s portrait of the Countess Solomoni of
Serravalle in his Journey to Calvary, or as in that of the
Vecchietto (in each case a supposed benefactress and benefactor)
an exception was made; in most others it seems to have been
understood that whatever else the figures were to be, they must
not be portraits.</p>

D&rsquo;ENRICO</i></span><span class="GutSmall">.</span></h2>
<p><span class="smcap">Before</span> going through the various
chapels <i>seriatim</i>, it may be well to give a short account
of three out of the four most interesting figures among the
numerous artists who worked on the Sacro Monte.&nbsp; By these I
mean, of course, Gaudenzio Ferrari, Tabachetti, Giovanni
d&rsquo;Enrico, and the sculptor, whoever he may have been, of
the Massacre of the Innocents chapel.&nbsp; I take my account of
Gaudenzio chiefly from Colombo&rsquo;s admirable work, and from
the not less excellent notice by Signor Tonetti, that appeared in
the &ldquo;Museo Storico ed Artistico Valsesiano&rdquo; for July
and August 1885.</p>
<p>Gaudenzio Ferrari was born, according to the general belief,
in 1484, but Colombo shows reasons for thinking that this date is
some four or five years too late.&nbsp; His father was named
Antonio Lanfranco or Franchino. <a name="citation90"></a><a
href="#footnote90" class="citation">[90]</a>&nbsp; He too was a
painter, but nothing is known of him or his works beyond the fact
that he lived at Valduggia, where his son Gaudenzio was born,
married a woman whose surname was Vinzio, and was dead by
1510.&nbsp; Gaudenzio in his early years several times signed his
pictures with his mother&rsquo;s name, calling himself Vincius,
De Vincio, or De Vince.</p>
<p>He is generally said to have studied first under Gerolamo
Giovenone of Vercelli, but this painter was not born till 1491,
and we have the authority of Lomazzo for saying that
Gaudenzio&rsquo;s chief instructor was Stefano Scotto, a painter
of Milan, who kept a school that was more or less a rival to that
of Leonardo da Vinci.&nbsp; I have myself no doubt that Gaudenzio
Ferrari has given Scotto&rsquo;s portrait in at least three of
the works he has left behind him at Varallo, but will return to
this subject when I come to deal with the various places in which
these portraits appear.&nbsp; His first works of importance, or
at least the earliest that remain to us, are probably in or in
the immediate vicinity of Varallo; but little is known of his
early years and work, beyond what is comprised in the three pages
that form the second chapter of Colombo&rsquo;s book.&nbsp; There
is an early <i>ancona</i> at La Rocca, near Varallo, another in
the <i>parocchia</i> of Gattinara, and possibly a greatly damaged
Piet&agrave; in the cloisters of Sta. Maria delle Grazie at
Varallo may be, as it is said to be, an early work by
Gaudenzio.&nbsp; Besides these, the wreck of the frescoes on the
Piet&agrave; chapel on the Sacro Monte, and other works on the
same site, now lost, belong to his earlier years.</p>
<p>Some believe that about the year 1506 he travelled to Perugia,
Florence, and Rome, where he made the acquaintance of Raphael,
and perhaps studied under Perugino, but Colombo has shown on what
very slender, if any, grounds this belief is based, and evidently
inclines to the belief that Gaudenzio never went to Rome, nor
indeed, probably, outside Lombardy at all.&nbsp; The only one of
Gaudenzio&rsquo;s works in which I can myself see anything that
may perhaps be called a trace of Umbrian influence, is in the
fresco of Christ disputing with the Doctors, in the chapel of
Sta. Margherita, in the Church of Sta. Maria delle Grazie at
Varallo.&nbsp; This fresco, as Signor Arienta has pointed out to
me, contains a strong reminiscence of the architectural
background in Raphael&rsquo;s school of Athens; it was
painted&mdash;so far as an illegible hieroglyphic signature can
be taken as read, and so far as internal evidence of style may be
relied upon, somewhere about the year.&nbsp; If Gaudenzio was for
the moment influenced by Raphael, he soon shook off the influence
and formed a style of his own, from which he did not depart,
except as enriching and enlarging his manner with advancing
experience.&nbsp; Moreover, Colombo (p. 75) points out that the
works by Raphael to which Gaudenzio&rsquo;s Disputa is supposed
to present an analogy, were not finished till 1511, and are hence
probably later than Gaudenzio&rsquo;s fresco.&nbsp; Perhaps both
painters drew from some common source.</p>
<p>In 1508 he was at Vercelli, and on the 26th of July signed a
contract to paint a picture for the church of S. Anna.&nbsp; He
is described in the deed as &ldquo;Gaudentius de
Varali.&rdquo;&nbsp; He had by this time married his first wife,
by whom he had two children, Gerolamo and Margherita, born in
1508 and 1512.&nbsp; In 1510 he undertook to paint an altarpiece
for the main church at Arona, and completed it in 1511, signing
the work &ldquo;<i>Magister Gaudentius de Vince</i>, <i>filius
quondam magistri Lanfranchi habitator vallis
Siccid&aelig;</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp; In 1513 he painted the
magnificent series of frescoes in the church of Sta. Maria delle
Grazie at Varallo, signing the work and dating it, this time more
legibly than he had done his earlier work in the chapel of St.
Margaret.&nbsp; In July 1514 he signed a contract to paint an
altarpiece for the Basilica of S. Gaudenzio at Novara.&nbsp; It
was to be completed within eighteen months from the date of the
contract and doubtless was so, but Gaudenzio found a good deal of
difficulty in getting his money, which was not paid in full till
1521.&nbsp; He is occasionally met with at Novara and Vercelli
between the years 1515 and 1524, but his main place of abode was
Varallo.</p>
<p>No date can be positively assigned for his great Crucifixion
chapel on the Sacro Monte, but it belongs probably to the years
1524&ndash;1528.&nbsp; I have already said that I can find no
dates scrawled on the walls earlier than 1529.&nbsp; Such dates
may be found yet, but if they are not found, it may be assumed
that the chapel was not thrown open to the public much before
that year.&nbsp; There is still a little relievo employed in the
fresco background, but not nearly so much as in the church of
Sta. Maria delle Grazie, and the increase of freedom is so
evident that it is difficult not to suppose an interval of a good
many years between the two works.&nbsp; I gather that by the year
1520 Gaudenzio had abandoned the use of gold and of
<i>relievo</i> in painting, but he may have made an exception in
the case of a work which was to consist both of sculpture and
painting; and there is indeed a good deal to be said in favour of
relievo in such a case, as helping to unite the sculptured and
painted portions of the work.&nbsp; Even in the Magi chapel, the
frescoes of which are several years later than those in the
Crucifixion chapel, there are still a few bosses of relievo in
the horses&rsquo; trappings.&nbsp; The date usually assigned to
the Crucifixion chapel is 1524, and, in default of more precise
knowledge, we shall do well to adhere to the date 1524&ndash;1528
already suggested.</p>
<p>About 1524 Gaudenzio painted a picture for the Sacristy of the
Cathedral of Novara, and Signor Tonetti says that the very
beautiful picture behind the high altar in the church of S.
Gaudenzio at Varallo is generally assigned to about the same
period.&nbsp; He goes on to say that in 1526 Gaudenzio was
certainly working at his native village of Valduggia, where, in
1524 or 1525, a chapel had been erected in honour of S. Rocco,
who it was supposed had kept the Valsesia free from the plague
that had devastated other parts of Italy.&nbsp; This chapel
Gaudenzio decorated with frescoes that have now disappeared, but
whose former existence is recorded in an inscription placed in
1793, when the chapel was restored.&nbsp; The inscription runs:
&ldquo;<i>Quod populus &agrave; peste denfensori erigebat an</i>
MDXXVI <i>Gaudentius Ferrarius patritius ex voto pictur&acirc;
decorabat</i>,&rdquo; &amp;c.</p>
<p>In 1528 he transferred his abode to Vercelli, and about the
same year married again.&nbsp; His second wife was a widow who
had a boy of ten years old by Giovanni Antonio del Olmo, of
Bergamo.&nbsp; Her name was Maria Mattia della Foppa; she came
from Morbegno in the Valtellina, and was of the same family as
Vincenzo Foppa, the reputed founder of the Milanese school of
painting.&nbsp; In 1532 he married his daughter Margherita to
Domenico Pertegalle, surnamed Festa, of Crevola near
Varallo&mdash;he and his son Gerolamo undertaking to give her a
dowry of 500 <i>lire imperiale</i>, payable in four years, and
secured by mortgage on Gaudenzio&rsquo;s house in Varallo.</p>
<p>In 1536 he painted the cupola of the church of the Madonna dei
Miracoli at Saronno; he then returned to Vercelli, but his abode
and movements are somewhat obscure till 1539, when it is certain
that he left Varallo for ever, settled in Milan, and died there
between the years 1546 and 1549.&nbsp; He does not appear to have
continued to reside in Vercelli after 1536; we may perhaps,
therefore, think that he returned for a time to Varallo, and that
the frescoes on the Magi chapel should be given to some date
between 1536 and 1539.&nbsp; They are certainly several years
later than those in the Crucifixion chapel; but I will return to
these frescoes when I come to the Magi chapel itself.</p>
<p>In 1539 he lost his son Gerolamo, and Colombo ascribes his
departure from Varallo to grief; but we cannot forget that in the
year 1538 there broke out a violent quarrel between the
ecclesiastics of the Sacro Monte and the lay governors of
Varallo.&nbsp; Fassola says that in 1530 Gio. Ant.&nbsp;
Scarrognini, grandson of Milano Scarrognini, and some time
afterwards Gio. Angiolo Draghetti, were made Fabbricieri.&nbsp;
The election of this last was opposed by the ecclesiastics, who
wished to see certain persons elected who were already proctors
of the convent, but the Vicini held out, and carried the
day.&nbsp; Party feeling ran so high, and the Fathers wished to
have such absolute control over the keys of the various money
boxes attached to the chapels, and over all other matters, that
it may well have been difficult for Gaudenzio to avoid coming
into collision with one or both of these contending parties;
matters came to a head in the year 1538, and his leaving Varallo
for ever about this time may, perhaps, be referred to his finding
himself in an intolerable position, as well as to the death of
his son; but, however this may be, he sold his house on the 5th
of August, 1539, for seven hundred <i>lire imperiali</i>, and for
the rest of his life resided in Milan, where he executed several
important works, for which I must refer my readers to the pages
of Colombo.</p>
<p>The foregoing meagre notice is all that my space allows me to
give concerning the life of this great master.&nbsp; I will
conclude it with a quotation from Signor Morelli which I take
from Sir Henry Layard&rsquo;s recent edition of Kugler&rsquo;s
Handbook of Painting (vol. ii. p. 424).&nbsp; Signor Morelli is
quoted as saying&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Gaudenzio Ferrari is inferior to very few
of his contemporaries, and occasionally, as in some of those
groups of men and women in the great Crucifixion at Varallo, he
might challenge comparison with Raphael himself.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It would be a bad business for Raphael if he did.&nbsp;
Gaudenzio Ferrari was what Raphael is commonly believed to have
been.&nbsp; I do not mean, that he was the prince of
painters&mdash;such expressions are always hyperbolical; there
has been no prince of painters; I mean that Gaudenzio
Ferrari&rsquo;s feeling was profound, whereas Raphael&rsquo;s was
at best only skin deep.&nbsp; Nevertheless Signor Morelli is
impressed with Ferrari&rsquo;s greatness, and places him,
&ldquo;for all in all, as regards inventive genius, dramatic
life, and picturesqueness * * far above Luini.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Bernardino Luini must stand so very high that no one can be
placed far above him; nevertheless, it is hard not to think that
Gaudenzio Ferrari was upon the whole the stronger man.</p>
<h3><span class="smcap">Tabachetti</span>.</h3>
<p>Great and fascinating as Gaudenzio was, I have already said
that I find Tabachetti a still more interesting figure.&nbsp; He
had all Gaudenzio&rsquo;s love of beauty, coupled with a
robustness, and freedom from mannerism and self-repetition, that
are not always observable in Gaudenzio&rsquo;s work.&nbsp; If
Gaudenzio has never received anything approaching to his due meed
of praise, Tabachetti may be almost said never to have been
praised at all.&nbsp; In Varallo, indeed, and its neighbourhood
he is justly regarded as a giant, but the art world generally
knows not so much as his name.&nbsp; Cicognara, L&uuml;bke, and
Perkins know not of his existence, nor of that of Varallo itself,
nor of any Valsesian school of sculpture.&nbsp; I have shown that
so admirable a writer as Mr. King never even alludes to him,
while the most recent authority of any reputed eminence on
Italian art thinks that the Titan of terra-cotta was a painter
and a pupil of Gaudenzio Ferrari.</p>
<p>Zani, indeed, in his &ldquo;<i>Enciclopedia
Metodica</i>,&rdquo; <a name="citation100a"></a><a
href="#footnote100a" class="citation">[100a]</a> and Nagler in
his &ldquo;<i>K&uuml;nstler Lexicon</i>,&rdquo; <a
name="citation100b"></a><a href="#footnote100b"
class="citation">[100b]</a> to which works my attention was
directed by Mr. Donoghue of the British Museum, both mention
Tabachetti.&nbsp; The first calls him
&ldquo;<i>bravissimo</i>,&rdquo; but makes him a Novarese, and
calls him &ldquo;<i>Scultore</i>, <i>plasticalore</i>,
<i>Pittore</i>,&rdquo; and &ldquo;<i>Incisore di stampe &agrave;
bulino</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp; The second says that Bartoli (Opp. mor.
I. 2), calls him a Flemish sculptor; that he made forty small
chapels and several hermitages at Crea in the Monferrato
district; and that he also worked much at Varallo.&nbsp; I have
in vain tried to find the passage in Bartoli to which Nagler
refers, and should be much obliged to any one who is more
fortunate if he will give me a fuller reference.&nbsp; The
&ldquo;Opp. mor.&rdquo; referred to appears to be a translation
of the &ldquo;Opuscoli morali&rdquo; of L. B. Alberti, published
at Venice in 1568, which is too early for Tabachetti.&nbsp; I
have had Bartoli&rsquo;s translation before me, but could
discover nothing.&nbsp; Nagler&rsquo;s words run:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Tabachetti Johann Baptist, nennt Bartoli
(Opp. mor. I. 2), einen Niederl&auml;indischen Bildhauer, ohne
seine Lebenzeit zu bestimmen.&nbsp; In der Kirche U.L.F. Tu Creo
(<i>sic</i>) (Montferrat) stellte er in vierzig kleinen capellen
die Geschichte der heil.&nbsp; Jungfrau, des Heilandes und
einiger Einsidler dar. Auch in Varallo arbeitete er
vieles.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If little is known about Gaudenzio we know still less about
Tabachetti.&nbsp; I do not believe that more is yet ascertained
than I can give in the next few pages.&nbsp; His name was Jean
Baptiste Tabaquet, and he came from Dinant in Belgium.&nbsp; This
fact has only come to my knowledge within the last few weeks, and
I have been unable to go to Dinant and see whether anything can
be there made out about him.&nbsp; I will thankfully receive any
information which any one is good enough to send me upon this
subject.&nbsp; It is not known when he came to Varallo, but by
the year 1586 his great Calvary chapel was undoubtedly finished,
as also, I imagine, the Adam and Eve, and Temptation chapels, all
three of which are mentioned in the 1586 edition of Caccia.&nbsp;
In the 1590 edition, the abbreviated word &ldquo;bellissi.&rdquo;
has been added to the description of the Calvary chapel, as
though it were an oversight in the earlier edition to take no
note of the remarkable excellence of the work: there can be no
doubt, therefore, that Bordiga and the other principal
authorities are wrong in dating this chapel 1606.&nbsp; How much
earlier it may be than 1586 I cannot determine till the missing
editions of Caccia are found, but there is not enough other work
of Tabachetti&rsquo;s on the Sacro Monte to let us suppose that
he had worked there for very many years.</p>
<p>Both Fassola and Torrotti say that he began the Visit of Mary
to Elizabeth, but went mad, leaving the work to be completed by
another artist.&nbsp; It was generally supposed that this was the
end of him, but there can be no doubt that, if ever he went mad
at all, it was only for a short time, as a consequence of
over-fatigue, and perhaps worry, over his gigantic work, the
Journey to Calvary chapel.&nbsp; That he was either absent from
Varallo, or at Varallo but unable to work, between the years 1586
and 1590, is certain, for, in the first place, there is no work
on the Sacro Monte that can possibly be given to him during these
years, and in the second, if he had been available, considering
the brilliant success of his Calvary chapel, the Massacre of the
Innocents, which dates from 1586&ndash;1590, would surely have
been entrusted to him, instead of to Rossetti or
Bargnola&mdash;whichever of these two is the rightful
sculptor.&nbsp; Nevertheless it is certain that after the end of
1589, to which date the edition of Caccia appears by its preface
to belong, Tabachetti reappeared in full force, did one chapel of
extreme beauty&mdash;the first Vision of St. Joseph&mdash;and
nothing more&mdash;unless indeed the Vecchietto be assigned to
this date.&nbsp; We know this, inasmuch as the First Vision of
St. Joseph chapel is not mentioned at all in either the 1586 or
1590 editions of Caccia, and was evidently not yet even
contemplated, whereas the Visit of Mary to Elizabeth, over which
he is supposed to have gone mad, is given in both as
completed.</p>
<p>Tabachetti was summoned to Crea in 1591, and was buying land
and other property in 1600, 1602, 1604, 1605, 1606, and 1608, at
Serralunga, close to Crea, where deeds which still exist say that
he resided.&nbsp; There are many families named Tabachetti still
living in the immediate neighbourhood of Serralunga, who are
doubtless descended from the sculptor.&nbsp; After 1608 nothing
more is known of him.&nbsp; At Varallo, over and above his work
on the Sacro Monte, there is an exceedingly beautiful Madonna by
him, in the parish church of S. Gaudenzio, and one head of a man
with a ruff&mdash;a mere fragment&mdash;which Cav. Prof. Antonini
showed me in the Museum, and assured me was by Tabachetti.&nbsp;
I know of no other work by him except what remains at Crea, about
which I will presently write more fully.&nbsp; I am not, however,
without hope that search about Liege and Dinant may lead to the
discovery of some work at present overlooked, and, as I have
said, will thankfully receive information.</p>
<p>I will conclude with a note taken from p. 47 of Part I. of
Cav. Alessandro Godio&rsquo;s admirable &ldquo;Cronaca di
Crea.&rdquo; <a name="citation104"></a><a href="#footnote104"

<p>The note runs:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;The present writer found himself involved
in a long dispute, through having entered the lists against the
Valsesian writers, who reckon Tabachetti among the distinguished
sons of the Val Sesia, and for having said that he was born in
Flanders.&nbsp; After a more successful search in the above-named
[Vercelli?] archive, under the letter B No. 6, over and above the
deeds of 1600 and 1606, already referred to in the &lsquo;Vesillo
della libert&agrave;,&rsquo; No. 39, Sept. 5, 1863, I found,
under numbers 308, 417, 498, 622, of the unarranged papers of
Notary Teodoro Caligaris, four more deeds dated 1602, 1604, 1605,
1608, in which the Sculptor Gio. Battista Tabachetti is not only
described as a Fleming, but his birthplace is given as follows:
&ldquo;<i>Vendidit</i>, <i>tradidit nobili Joanni Tabacheta filio
quondam nobili Gulielmi de Dinante de Liesa</i>
[<i>Li&egrave;ge</i>] <i>nunc incola
Serralung&aelig;</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp; Since, then, he was buying
considerable property at Serralunga during the above-named year,
it is plain that he did not work continuously at Varallo from
1590 to 1606, as contended by the Valsesian writers quoted by An.
Cav. Carlo Dionisotti, the distinguished author of the Valle
Sesia.&nbsp; Moreover, from the year 1590 and onward the chapels
of Crea were begun, and of these, by advice of Monsignor Tullio
del Carretto, Bishop of Casale, at the bidding of Michel Angelo
da Liverno, who was Vicar of Crea, Tabachetti designed not
fifteen but forty, and found himself at the head of the direction
of the great work that was then engaging the attention of the
foremost Italian artists of the day.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<h3><span class="smcap">Giovanni D&rsquo;Enrico</span>.</h3>
<p>For my account of Giovanni D&rsquo;Enrico I turn to Signor
Galloni&rsquo;s &ldquo;<i>Uomini e fatti celebri di Valle
Sesia</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp; He was second of three brothers,
Melchiorre, Giovanni, and Antonio, commonly called Tanzio, who
were born at the German-speaking village of Alagna, that stands
at the head of the Val Sesia.&nbsp; Signor Galloni says that the
elder brother, Melchiorre, painted the frescoes in the Temptation
chapel in 1594, and the Last Judgment on the facciata of the
parish church at Riva in 1597.</p>
<p>The house occupied by the family of D&rsquo;Enrico was, as I
gather from a note communicated to Signor Galloni by Cav. Don
Farinetti of Alagna, in the fraction of Alagna called Giacomolo,
where a few years ago a last descendant of the family was still
residing.&nbsp; The house is of wood, old and black with smoke;
on the wooden gallery or lobby that runs in front of it, and
above the low and narrow doorways, there is an inscription or
verse of the Bible, &ldquo;<i>Allein Gott Ehere</i>,&rdquo; dated
1609.&nbsp; The small oratory hard by is said to have been also
the property of the D&rsquo;Enrico family, and in the
<i>ancona</i> of the little altar there is a picture representing
the Virgin of not inconsiderable merit, with a beautiful gilded
frame in excellent preservation.&nbsp; On the background of this
picture there is the stemma of the D&rsquo;Enrico family, and an
inscription in Latin bearing the names of John and Eva
D&rsquo;Enrico.</p>
<p>The exact dates of the births of the three brothers are
unknown, but the eldest and youngest were described in a
certificate of good character, dated February 11, 1600, as
&ldquo;<i>juvenes bon&aelig; vocis</i>, <i>conditionis et
fam&aelig;</i>,&rdquo; so that if we assume Melchiorre to have
been born in 1575, <a name="citation106"></a><a
href="#footnote106" class="citation">[106]</a> Giovanni in 1580,
and Antonio in 1585, we shall, in no case, be more than five
years or so in error.&nbsp; I own to being able to see little
merit in any of Melchiorre&rsquo;s work, of which the reader will
find a sample in the frescoes behind the old Adam and Eve, which
is given to face p. 121, but it is believed that he for the most
part painted the terra-cotta figures, rather than
backgrounds.&nbsp; Nor do I like the work of Tanzio&mdash;which
may be seen, perhaps, to the best advantage in the Herod
chapel.&nbsp; Tanzio, however, was a stronger man than
Melchiorre.&nbsp; Giovanni was incomparably the ablest of the
three brothers, and it is to him alone that I will ask the reader
to devote attention.</p>
<p>Signor Galloni calls Giovanni D&rsquo;Enrico a pupil of
Tabachetti, probably following Bordiga, but I have not seen the
evidence on which this generally received opinion is based;
Tabachetti had finally left Varallo by 1591, when Giovanni
D&rsquo;Enrico was little more than a child, and though he may
have been sent to work under Tabachetti at Crea, I have not come
across anything to show this was so.&nbsp; He was an architect as
well as sculptor, and is believed to have made the modification
of Pellegrino Tibaldi&rsquo;s designs that was ultimately adopted
for the Palazzo di Pilato, Caiaphas, and Herod chapels.&nbsp; He
was also architect of the Chiesa Maggiore on the Sacro Monte, his
design having been approved April 1, 1614.&nbsp; He is believed
to have done a Madonna and child, a St. Rocco, and a St.
Sebastian in the parish church at Alagna; he also sent many
figures away, some of which may possibly be found in the disused
chapels of Graglia, if indeed these contain anything at
all.&nbsp; He died at Montrigone near Borgosesia in 1644, while
superintending the work of his pupil and collaborateur Giacomo
Ferro, who, it is said, has placed his master&rsquo;s portrait
near the bed of S. Anna in his chapel of the Birth of the Virgin
(?) at Montrigone.&nbsp; Others say that the figure in question
does not represent D&rsquo;Enrico, and that his portrait is found
in a niche in the chapel itself, but Signor Galloni assures us
that there is nothing but tradition in favour of either
view.&nbsp; Giacomo Ferro appears to have been his only pupil and
his only collaborateur.&nbsp; There can, I think, be little doubt
that the greater part of the work generally ascribed to
D&rsquo;Enrico is really by Giacomo Ferro, and the uncertainty as
to what figures are actually by D&rsquo;Enrico himself makes it
very difficult to form a just opinion about his genius.&nbsp;
Some chapels are given to him, as for example the Flagellation
and Crowning with Thorns, which are mentioned as completed in the
1586 edition of Caccia, when D&rsquo;Enrico was at most a
child.&nbsp; True, he may have remodelled these chapels, but I
have not yet met with evidence that he actually did so, though I
dare say such evidence may exist without my knowing it.</p>
<p>In those in which he was undoubtedly assisted by Giacomo
Ferro, as for example the Caiaphas, Herod, four Pilate, and
Nailing to the Cross chapels, with possibly the Ecce Homo,
perhaps the safest rule will be to give the few really excellent
figures that are to be found in each of them to D&rsquo;Enrico
himself and to ascribe all the inferior work, of which
unfortunately there is too much, to Giacomo Ferro.&nbsp; That the
assistance rendered by him was on a very large scale may be
gathered from the fact that there was a deed drawn up between him
and his master whereby he was to receive half the money that was
paid to D&rsquo;Enrico,&mdash;a quasi partnership indeed seems to
have existed between the two sculptors.&nbsp; This deed is
referred to by Signor Galloni on page 178 of his &ldquo;Uomini e
Fatti,&rdquo; and on the same page he gives us an extract from a
lawsuit between Giacomo Ferro and the town of Varallo which gives
us a curious insight into the manner in which the artists of the
Sacro Monte were paid.&nbsp; From a <i>proc&egrave;s-verbal</i>
in connection with this suit Signor Galloni quotes the following
extract:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;And further the said deputies allege that
in the accounts rendered by the said master Giovanni
D&rsquo;Enrico in respect of the pontifical thrones in the
Caiaphas and Nailing to the Cross chapels, these have been valued
at the rate of four statues for each several throne and horse,
whereas it appears from old accounts rendered by other statuaries
that they have been hitherto charged only at the rate of three
statues for each throne and horse.&nbsp; Wherefore the said
deputies claim to deduct the overcharge of one statue for each
horse and throne, which being thirteen at the rate of 10 and a
quarter scudi for each figure, would give a total deduction of
132 and a half scudi.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It appears in another part of the same
<i>proc&egrave;s-verbal</i> that Giovanni D&rsquo;Enrico had been
paid in 1640 the sum of 4240 lire and 8 soldi.</p>
<p>Giacomo Ferro and his brother Antonio were Giovanni
D&rsquo;Enrico&rsquo;s heirs, from which it would appear that he
either died unmarried, or left no children.</p>
<p>To say that D&rsquo;Enrico will compare with Tabachetti would
be an obvious exaggeration, and, indeed, there are only very few
figures on the Sacro Monte about which we can feel certain that
they are by him at all.&nbsp; The Caiaphas, Herod, Laughing Boys
in the Herod chapel, and the Man with the Two Children in the
Ecce Homo chapel cannot, I think, be given to any one else, but
at this moment I do not call to mind more than some fourteen or
fifteen figures out of the three hundred or so that are ascribed
to him, about which we can be as certain that they are by
D&rsquo;Enrico as we can be that most of those given to
Tabachetti and Gaudenzio are actually by them.&nbsp; For not only
have we to reckon with Giacomo Ferro, who, if he had half the
pay, we may be sure did not less than half the figures, and
probably very much more, but we must reckon with the figures
taken from older chapels when reconstructed, as in
D&rsquo;Enrico&rsquo;s time was the case with several.&nbsp; What
became of the figures in Gaudenzio Ferrari&rsquo;s original
Journey to Calvary chapel, and in other works by him that were
cancelled when the Palazzo di Pilato chapel was built?&nbsp; It
is not likely they were destroyed if by any hook or crook they
could be made to do duty in some other shape; more probably they
are most of them still existing up and down
D&rsquo;Enrico&rsquo;s various chapels, but so doctored, if the
expression may be pardoned, that Gaudenzio himself would not know
them.&nbsp; In the Ecce Homo chapel we can say with confidence
that the extreme figure to the left is by Gaudenzio, and has been
taken from some one of his chapels now lost; we are able to
detect this by an accident, but there are other figures in the
same chapel and not a few elsewhere, about which we can have no
confidence that they have not been taken from some earlier chapel
either by Gaudenzio or some one else.&nbsp; What, then, with
these figures, and what with Giacomo Ferro, it is not easy to say
what D&rsquo;Enrico did or did not do.</p>
<p>The intercalated figures have been fitted into the work with
admirable skill, nevertheless they do not form part of design,
and make it want the unity observable in the work of Tabachetti
and Gaudenzio.&nbsp; They have been lugged into the composition,
and no matter how skilful their introduction, are soon felt, as
in the case of the Vecchietto, to have no business where they
are.&nbsp; Moreover, D&rsquo;Enrico shows his figures off, which
Tabachetti never does: the result is that in his chapels each
figure has its attention a good deal drawn to the desirableness
of neither being itself lost sight of, nor impeding the view of
its neighbours.&nbsp; This is fatal, and though Giacomo Ferro is
doubtless more practically guilty in the matter than
D&rsquo;Enrico, yet D&rsquo;Enrico is the responsible author of
the work, and must bear the blame accordingly.&nbsp; Standing
once with Signor Pizetta of Varallo, before
D&rsquo;Enrico&rsquo;s great Nailing of Christ to the Cross
chapel, I asked him casually how he thought it compared with
Tabachetti&rsquo;s Journey to Calvary.&nbsp; He replied
&ldquo;<i>Questo non sacrifica niente</i>,&rdquo; meaning that
Tabachetti thought of the action much and but little of whether
or no the actors got in each other&rsquo;s way, whereas
D&rsquo;Enrico was mainly bent on making his figures steer clear
of one another.&nbsp; Thus his chapels want the concert and unity
of action that give such life to Tabachetti&rsquo;s.&nbsp;
Nevertheless, in spite of the defect above referred to, it is
impossible to deny that the sculptor of the Herod and Caiaphas
figures was a man of very rare ability, nor can the general
verdict which assigns him the third place among the workers on
the Sacro Monte be reasonably disputed.&nbsp; But this third
place must be given rather in respect of quantity than quality,
for in dramatic power and highly-wrought tragic action he is
inferior to the sculptor, whoever he may be, of the Massacre of
the Innocents chapel, to which I will return when I come to the
chapel in question.</p>
<p>I may say in passing that Cicognara, L&uuml;bke, and Perkins
have all omitted to mention Giovanni D&rsquo;Enrico as a
sculptor, though Nagler mentions his two brothers as
painters.&nbsp; Nagler gives the two brothers D&rsquo;Enrico as
all bearing the patronymic Tanzio, which I am told is in reality
only a corruption of the Christian name of the third
brother.&nbsp; Zani mentions Giovanni D&rsquo;Enrico as well as
his two brothers, and calls him &ldquo;<i>celebre</i>,&rdquo; but
he calls all the three brothers &ldquo;Tanzii, Tanzi, Tanzio, or
Tanzo.&rdquo;</p>

114</span>CHAPTER IX.<br />
<span class="GutSmall"><i>THE ASCENT</i></span><span
class="GutSmall">, </span><span class="GutSmall"><i>AND THE FIRST
FOUR CHAPELS</i></span><span class="GutSmall">.</span></h2>
<p><span class="smcap">The</span> ascent to the Sacro Monte
begins immediately after the church of Sta. Maria delle Grazie
has been passed, and is made by a large broad road paved with
rounded stones, and beautifully shaded by the chestnuts that grow
on the steep side of the mountain.&nbsp; The old road up the
mountain was below the present, and remains of it may yet be
seen.&nbsp; Ere long a steeper narrower road branches off to the
right hand, which makes rather a shorter cut, and is commonly
called the &ldquo;<i>Strada della Madonna</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp; From
this name it has become generally believed that the Madonna once
actually came to Varallo to see the Sacro Monte, and took this
shorter road.&nbsp; There is no genuine tradition, however, to
this effect, and the belief may be traced to misapprehension of a
passage in Fassola and Torrotti, who say that the main road
represents the path taken by Christ himself on his journey to
Calvary, while the other symbolises the short cut taken by the
Virgin when she went to rejoin him after his resurrection.&nbsp;
When he was <i>Assistente</i>, which I gather to have been much
what the Director of the Sacro Monte is now, Torrotti had some
poetry put up to say this.</p>
<p>At the point where the two roads again meet there is a large
wooden cross, from which the faithful may help themselves to a
chip.&nbsp; That they do get chips is evident by the state of the
cross, but the wood is hard, and none but the very faithful will
get so much but that plenty will be left for those who may come
after them.&nbsp; I saw a stout elderly lady trying to get a chip
last summer; she was baffled, puzzled, frowned a good deal, and
was perspiring freely.&nbsp; She tried here, and she tried there,
but could get no chip; and presently began to cry.&nbsp; Jones
and I had been watching her perplexity, as we came up the
<i>Strada della Madonna</i>, and having a stouter knife than hers
offered to help her.&nbsp; She was most grateful, when, not
without difficulty, Jones succeeded in whittling for her a piece
about an inch long, and as thick as the wood of a match
box.&nbsp; &ldquo;Per Bacco,&rdquo; she exclaimed, still
agitated, and not without asperity, &ldquo;I never saw such a
cross in my life.&rdquo;&nbsp; The old cross, considered to be
now past further whittling, was lying by the roadside ready to be
taken away.&nbsp; I had wanted to get the lady a chip from this,
thinking it looked as if it would lend itself more easily to the
design, but she said it would not do.&nbsp; They have a new cross
every year, and they always select a hard knotty uncompromising
piece of wood for the purpose.&nbsp; The old is then taken away
and burnt for firewood.</p>
<p>Of this cross Fassola says it was here (&ldquo;<i>e qu&igrave;
f&ugrave; dove</i>&rdquo;) the Virgin met her son, and that for
this reason a small chapel was placed rather higher up, which
represents the place where she took a little rest, and was hence
called the Capella del Riposo.&nbsp; It was decorated with
frescoes by Gaudenzio, which have long since disappeared; these
were early works, and among the first undertaken by him on the
Sacro Monte; the chapel remains, but may, and probably will, be
passed without notice.&nbsp; A little higher still, there is
another very small and unimportant chapel containing a decayed
St. Jerome by Giovanni D&rsquo;Enrico, and above this, facing the
visitor at the last turn of the road, is the chapel erected in
memory of Cesare Maio, or Maggi, a Neapolitan, Marquis of
Moncrivelli, and one of Charles the Fifth&rsquo;s generals.&nbsp;
He died in 1568.&nbsp; Many years before his death he had
commanded an armed force against the Valsesians, but when his
horse, on approaching Varallo, caught sight of the Sacro Monte,
it genuflected three times and pawed a great cross on the road
with its feet.&nbsp; This had such an effect upon the rider that
he had thenceforward to become a munificent benefactor of the
Sacro Monte, and expressly desired to be buried there.&nbsp; I do
not know where the horse was buried.&nbsp; His chapel contains
nothing of importance, nor yet does the small oratory with a
crucifix in memory of a benefactor, one Giovanni Pschel Alemanno;
this is at the top of the ascent and close to the smaller
entrance to the Sacro Monte.</p>
<p>At this smaller entrance the visitor will be inclined to
enter, but he should not do so if he wishes to take the chapels
in the order in which they are numbered.&nbsp; He should continue
the broad road until he reaches the excellent inn kept by Signor
Topini, and the shops where &ldquo;<i>corone</i>&rdquo; and
pilgrims&rsquo; beads are sold.&nbsp; The inn and shops are
mentioned by Fassola and by Torrotti.&nbsp; Fassola in 1671 says
of the inn that it will afford accommodation for people of all
ranks, and that though any one with other curiosity may stay in
the town, those who would enjoy their devotion quietly and
diffusively can do so more at their ease here.&nbsp; Of the shops
he says that they sell &ldquo;<i>corone</i>, <i>Storie della
Fabrica</i>,&rdquo; &ldquo;and other like instruments of
devotion&rdquo; (&ldquo;<i>ed altri instromenti simili di
divozione</i>&rdquo; p. 80).&nbsp; Torrotti says they sell his
book there, with images, and various devout curiosities (<i>e
varie cose curiose di divozione</i>, p. 66).&nbsp; The shutters
are strong and probably the original ones.</p>
<p>At Varese there is a very beautiful lady, one among many
others hardly if at all less beautiful on the same mountain, of
whom I once asked what people did with these <i>Corone</i>.&nbsp;
She said, &ldquo;<i>Le adoperano per pregare</i>,&rdquo;
&ldquo;They make use of them to pray with.&rdquo;&nbsp; She then
asked whether the English ever prayed.&nbsp; I said of course
they did; that all nations, even the Turks, prayed.&nbsp;
&ldquo;<i>&Egrave; Turco lei</i>?&rdquo; she said, with a
singularly sweet, kind, and beneficent expression.&nbsp; I said I
was not, but I do not think she believed me.</p>
<p>Passing now under the handsome arch which forms the main
entrance to the sacred precincts we come to</p>
<h3><span class="smcap">Chapel No</span>. 1.&nbsp; <span
class="smcap">Adam and Eve</span>.</h3>
<p>This chapel is perhaps the only one in the case of which
Pellegrino Tibaldi&rsquo;s design was carried out; and even here
it has been in many respects modified.&nbsp; The figures are by
Tabachetti; and the original internal frescoes were by Domenico
Alfani Perugino, but they have perished and have lately been
replaced by some pieces from the life of Adam and Eve by
Professor Burlazzi of Varallo.&nbsp; The outer frescoes are said
by Bordiga to be by Giovanni Miel of Antwerp, but they are
probably in reality by one of the brothers Battista and Gio.
Mauro Rovere.&nbsp; I will, however, reserve remarks on this
subject until I come to the Massacre of the Innocents
chapel.&nbsp; The original frescoes do not appear to have been
executed till 1594&ndash;1600, but the terra-cotta work is
described as complete in the 1586 edition of Caccia in terms that
leave no doubt but that the present group is intended; it is
probably among the first works executed by Tabachetti on the
Sacro Monte, but how much earlier it is than 1586 cannot be known
till the missing editions of Caccia are found.&nbsp; That he did
the Adam and Eve is not doubted.&nbsp; If he also did the
animals, he had made great progress by the time he came to the
Temptation chapel, for the animals in this last chapel are far
finer than those in the Adam and Eve chapel.</p>
<p>The present chapel superseded an earlier one with the same
subject, which was probably on the site now occupied by the
Crowning with Thorns, inasmuch as in this chapel the fresco on
one wall still represents Adam and Eve being dismissed from
Paradise.&nbsp; Signor Arienta pointed this out to me, and I
think it sufficiently determines the position of the original
Adam and Eve chapel.&nbsp; The evidence for the existence of the
earlier chapel throws so much light upon the way in which figures
have been shifted about and whole chapels have disappeared,
leaving only an incidental trace or two behind them in some other
of those now existing, that I shall not hesitate to reproduce it
here.</p>
<p>We were told in the town that there had been an old Adam and
an old Eve, and that these two figures were now doing duty as
Roman soldiers in chapel No. 23, which represents the Capture of
Christ.&nbsp; On investigation, we found, against the wall, two
figures dressed as Roman soldiers that evidently had something
wrong with them.&nbsp; The draperies of all the other figures are
painted, either terra-cotta or wood, but with these two they are
real, being painted linen or calico, dipped in thin mortar or
plaster of Paris, and real drapery always means that the figure
has had something done to it.&nbsp; The armour, where armour
shows, is not quite of the same pattern as that painted on the
other figures, nor is it of the same make; in the case of the
remoter figure it does not go down far enough, and leaves a lucid
interval of what was evidently once bare stomach, but has now
been painted the brightest blue that could be found, so that it
does not catch the eye as flesh; a little further examination was
enough to make us strongly suspect that the figures had both been
originally nude, and in this case the story current in Varallo
was probably true.</p>

</a></p>
<p>Then the question arose, which was Adam, and which Eve?&nbsp;
The farther figure was the larger and therefore ought to have
been Adam, but it had long hair, and looked a good deal more like
a woman than the other did.&nbsp; The nearer figure had a beard
and moustaches, and was quite unlike a woman; true, we could see
no sign of bosom with the farther figure, but neither could we
with the nearer.&nbsp; On the whole, therefore, we settled it
that the nearer and moustached soldier was Adam, and the more
distant long-haired beardless one, Eve.&nbsp; In the evening,
however, Cav. Prof. Antonini and several of the other best
Varallo authorities were on the Sacro Monte, and had the grating
removed so that we could get inside the chapel, which we were not
slow to do.&nbsp; The state of the drapery showed that curiosity
had been already rife upon the subject, and, observing this,
Jones and I gently lifted as much of it as was necessary, and put
the matter for ever beyond future power of question that the
farther, long-haired, beardless figure was Adam, and the nearer,
moustached one, Eve.&nbsp; They are now looking in the same
direction, as joining in the hue and cry against Christ, but were
originally turned towards one another; the one offering, and the
other taking, the apple.</p>
<p>Tabachetti&rsquo;s Eve, in the Creation or Adam and Eve
chapel, is a figure of remarkable beauty, and a very great
improvement on her predecessor.&nbsp; The left arm is a
restoration by Cav. Prof. Antonini, but no one who was not told
of the fact would suspect it.&nbsp; The heads both of the Adam
and the Eve have been less successfully repainted than the rest
of the figures, and have suffered somewhat in consequence, but
the reader will note the freedom from any approach to
<i>barocco</i> maintained throughout the work.&nbsp; The serpent
is exceedingly fine, and the animals are by no means
unpleasing.&nbsp; Speaking for myself, I have found the work
continually grow upon me during the many years I have known
it.</p>

<p>The walls of this, and, indeed, of all the chapels, were once
covered with votive pictures recording the <i>Grazie</i> with
which each several chapel should be credited, but these generally
pleasing, though perhaps sometimes superstitious, minor
satellites of the larger artistic luminaries have long since
disappeared.&nbsp; It is plain that either the chapels are losing
their powers of bringing the <i>Grazie</i> about, or that we
moderns care less about saying &ldquo;thank you&rdquo; when we
have been helped out of a scrape than our forefathers did.&nbsp;
Fassola says:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Molti oltre questa non mancano di lasciar
qualche insigne memoria, cio&egrave; &ograve; li dinari per
incominciar, &ograve; finire qualche Capella, &ograve; per
qualche pittura &ograve; Statua, &ograve; altro non essendouene
pur&rsquo; vno di questi Benefattori, che non habbino ottenute le
grazie desiderate di Dio, e dalla Beata Vergine, del che piene ne
sono le carte, le mura delle Capelle, e Chiese con voti
d&rsquo;argento, ed altre infinite Tauolette, antichissime, e
moderne, voti di cera ed altro, oltre tanto da esprimersi grazie,
che &ograve; per pouert&agrave;, &ograve; per mancanza, &ograve;
per altri pensieri de&rsquo; graziati restano celate.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>For my own part I am sorry that these humble chronicles of
three centuries or so of hairbreadth escapes are gone.&nbsp;
Votive pictures have always fascinated me.&nbsp; Everything does
go so dreadfully wrong in them, and yet we know it will all be
set so perfectly right again directly, and that nobody will be
really hurt.&nbsp; Besides, they are so na&iuml;ve, and free from
&ldquo;high-falutin;&rdquo; they give themselves no airs, are not
review-puffed, and the people who paint them do not call one
another geniuses.&nbsp; They are business-like, direct, and
sensible; not unfrequently they acquire considerable historical
interest, and every now and then there is one by an old master
born out of due time&mdash;who probably wist not so much as even
that there were old masters.&nbsp; Here, if anywhere, may be
found smouldering, but still living, embers of the old art-fire
of Italy, and from these, more readily than from the hot-bed
atmosphere of the academies, may the flame be yet
rekindled.&nbsp; Lastly, if allowed to come as they like, and put
themselves where they will, they grow into a pretty, quilt-like,
artlessly-arranged decoration, that will beat any mere pattern
contrived of set purpose.&nbsp; Some half-dozen or so of the old
votive pictures are still preserved in the Museum at Varallo, and
are worthy of notice, one or two of them dating from the
fifteenth century, and a few late autumn leaves, as it were, of
images in wax still hang outside the Crowning with Thorns chapel,
but the chapels are, for the most part, now without them.&nbsp;
Each chapel was supposed to be beneficial in the case of some
particular bodily or mental affliction, and Fassola often winds
up his notice with a list of the Graces which are most especially
to be hoped for from devotion at the chapel he is describing; he
does not, however, ascribe any especial and particular Grace to
the first few chapels.&nbsp; A few <i>centesimi</i> and perhaps a
<i>soldo</i> or two still lie on the floor, thrown through the
grating by pilgrims, and the number of these which any chapel can
attract may be supposed to be a fair test of its
popularity.&nbsp; These <i>centesimi</i> are a source of
temptation to the small boys of Varallo, who are continually
getting into trouble for extracting them by the help of willow
wands and birdlime.&nbsp; I understand that when the
<i>centesimi</i> are picked up by the authorities, some few are
always left, on the same principle as that on which we leave a
nest egg in a hen&rsquo;s nest for the hen to lay a new one to; a
very little will do, but even the boys know that there must be a
germ of increment left, and when they stole the coppers from the
Ecce Homo chapel not long since, they still left one
<i>centesimo</i> and a waistcoat button on the floor.</p>
<h3><span class="smcap">Chapel No</span>. 2.&nbsp; <span
class="smcap">The Annunciation</span>.</h3>
<p>This was one of the earliest chapels, and is dated by Fassola
as from 1490 to 1500.&nbsp; There is no record of any
contemporary fresco background.&nbsp; Bordiga says that these
figures were originally in the chapel now occupied by the
Salutation of Mary by Elizabeth, but that having been long
objects of popular veneration they were preserved at the time
when Tabachetti took this block of buildings in hand.&nbsp; It
does not appear from any source what figures were in this chapel
before the Annunciation figures were brought here; possibly, as
it is supposed to be a reproduction of the Santa Casa di Loreto,
this was considered enough and it was untenanted.&nbsp; Bordiga
says, &ldquo;The faces and extremities have a divine expression
and are ancient,&rdquo; but both Fassola and Torrotti say that
Tabachetti gave the figures new heads.&nbsp; These last are
probably right; the Virgin has real drapery, which, as I have
said, always means that the figure has been cut about.</p>
<p>Whatever the change was, it had been effected before the
publication of the 1586 edition of Caccia, where the chapel is
described, in immediate sequence to the Adam and Eve chapel, and
in the following terms:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Si vede poi un poco discosto, un altro
Tempio, fatto ad imitatione della Cappella di Loreto, ben
adornato, dove &egrave; l&rsquo;Angelo che annontia l&rsquo;
incarnatione . . . . di relievo.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the poetical part of the same book the figures are very
warmly praised, as, indeed, they deserve to be.&nbsp; Fassola and
Torrotti both say that the Virgin was a very favourite
figure&mdash;so much so that pilgrims had loaded her with
jewels.&nbsp; One night, a thief tried to draw a valuable ring
from her finger, when she dealt him a stunning box on the ear
that stretched him senseless until he was apprehended and
punished.&nbsp; Fassola says of the affair:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Fr&agrave; gl&rsquo; altri &egrave; degna
di racconto la mortificazione hauuta da vn peruerso, che fatto
ardito, non s&ograve; da quale spirito diabolico, volendo rubbare
alcune di dette gioie, e forsi tutte, dalle mani della Beata
Vergine f&ugrave; reso immobile da vna guanciata della Vergine
fin&rsquo; &agrave; tanto, che la giustizia l&rsquo; hebbe nella
sua braccia; contempli ogn&rsquo; vno questa Statua, che ne
riporter&agrave; mosso il cuore.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Under the circumstances I should say he had better contemplate
her at a respectful distance.&nbsp; I can believe that the thief
was very much mortified, but the Virgin seems to have been a good
deal mortified too, for I suspect her new head was after this
occurrence and not before it.</p>
<p>Such miracles are still of occasional if not frequent
occurrence in connection with the Sacro Monte.&nbsp; I have a
broadside printed at Milan in 1882 in which a full account is
given of a recent miracle worked by the Blessed Virgin of the
Sacro Monte of Varallo.&nbsp; It is about a young man who had
been miraculously cured of a lingering illness that had baffled
the skill of all the most eminent professors; so his father sent
him with a lamp of gold and a large sum of money which he was to
offer to the Madonna.&nbsp; As he was on his way he felt tired
[it must be remembered that the railway was not opened till
1886], so he sat down under a tree and began to amuse himself by
counting the treasure.&nbsp; Hardly had he begun to count when he
was attacked by four desperate assassins, who with pistols and
poignards did their very utmost to despoil him, but it was not
the smallest use.&nbsp; One of the assassins was killed, and the
others were so cowed that they promised, if he would only fetch
them some &ldquo;devotions&rdquo; from the Sacro Monte, to
abandon their evil courses and thenceforth lead virtuous
lives.</p>
<p>We do not pitch our tracts quite so strongly, but need give
ourselves no airs in this matter.</p>
<h3><span class="smcap">Chapel No</span>. 3.&nbsp; <span
class="smcap">The Salutation of Mary by Elizabeth</span>.</h3>
<p>The walls of this chapel according to Fassola are old, but the
figures all new.&nbsp; Both Fassola and Torrotti say that
Tabachetti had just begun to work on this chapel when he lost his
reason, but as the work is described as complete in the 1586
edition of Caccia, it is evident, as I have already shown, that
his insanity was only temporary, inasmuch as he did another
chapel after 1590.&nbsp; Both writers are very brief in their
statement of the fact, Fassola only saying &ldquo;<i>quando era
diuenuto pazzo</i>,&rdquo; and Torrotti
&ldquo;<i>impazzitosi</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp; The fresco background is
meagre and forms no integral part of the design; this does not go
for much, but suggests that in the original state of the chapel,
which we know was an early one, there may have been but little
background, the fresco background not having yet attained its
full development.&nbsp; The figures would doubtless look better
than they do if they had not been loaded with many coats of shiny
paint, which has clogged some of the modelling; they are not very
remarkable, but improve upon examination, and it must be
remembered that the subject is one of exceeding difficulty.</p>
<h3><span class="smcap">Chapel No</span>. 4.&nbsp; <span
class="smcap">First Vision of St. Joseph</span>.</h3>
<p>Fassola and Torrotti say that this chapel was originally a
servant&rsquo;s lodge (&ldquo;ospizio delli serui della
Fabrica&rdquo;), and part of the building is still used as a
store-room.&nbsp; The servants were subsequently shifted to what
was then the chapel of the Capture of Christ, the figures in that
chapel being moved to the one in which they are now.&nbsp; The
original Capture chapel was on the ground floor of the large
house that stands on the right hand as one enters the small
entrance to the Sacro Monte which a visitor will be tempted to
take, opposite Giovanni Pschel&rsquo;s chapel, and a little below
the Temptation chapel.</p>

</a></p>
<p>The First Vision of St. Joseph is not mentioned in either the
1586 or 1590 editions of Caccia; we may therefore be certain that
it did not exist, and may also be sure that it was
Tabachetti&rsquo;s last work upon the Sacro Monte&mdash;for that
it is by him has never been disputed.&nbsp; It should probably be
dated early in 1591, by which time Tabachetti must have recovered
his reason and was on the point of leaving Varallo for
ever.&nbsp; I give a photograph of the very beautiful figure of
St. Joseph, which must rank among the finest on the Sacro
Monte.&nbsp; I grant that a sleeping figure is the easiest of all
subjects, except a dead one, inasmuch as Nature does not here
play against the artist with loaded dice, by being able to give
the immediate change of position which the artist cannot.&nbsp;
With sleep and death there is no change required, so that the
hardest sleeping figure is easier than the easiest waking one;
moreover, sleep is so touching and beautiful that it is one of
the most taking of all subjects; nevertheless there are sleeping
figures and sleeping figures, and the St. Joseph in the chapel we
are considering is greatly better than the second sleeping St.
Joseph in chapel No. 9, by whomsoever this figure may be&mdash;or
than the sleeping Apostles by D&rsquo;Enrico in chapel No.
22.</p>
<p>Cusa says that the Madonna is taken from a small figure
modelled by Gaudenzio still existing at Valduggia in the
possession of the Rivaroli family.&nbsp; She is a very pretty and
graceful figure, and is sewing on a pillow in the middle of the
composition&mdash;of course unmoved by the presence of the angel,
who is only visible to her husband.&nbsp; The angel is also a
remarkably fine figure.</p>

132</span>CHAPTER X.&nbsp; THE SEVEN CHAPELS NUMBERED
5&ndash;11.</h2>
<h3><span class="smcap">Chapel No</span>. 5.&nbsp; <span
class="smcap">Visit of the Magi</span>.</h3>
<p><span class="smcap">Fassola</span> says that this chapel was
begun about the year 1500, and completed about 1520, at the
expense of certain wealthy Milanese; Torrotti repeats this.&nbsp;
Bordiga gives it a later date, making Gaudenzio begin to work in
it in 1531; he supposes that Gaudenzio left Varallo suddenly in
that year to undertake work for the church of St. Cristoforo at
Vercelli without quite completing the Magi frescoes; and it is
indeed true that the frescoes appear to be unfinished, some parts
at first sight seeming only sketched in outline, as though the
work had been interrupted; but Colombo, whose industry is only
equalled by his fine instinct and good sense, refers both the
frescoes and their interruption to a later date.&nbsp; Still,
Fassola may have only intended, and indeed probably did intend,
that the shell of the building was completed by 1520, the figures
and frescoes being deferred for want of funds, though the
building was ready for occupation.</p>
<p>Colombo, on page 115 of his &ldquo;Life and Work of Gaudenzio
Ferrari,&rdquo; says that Bordiga remarked the obvious difference
in style between the frescoes in the Magi and the Crucifixion
chapels, which he held to have been completed in 1524, but
nevertheless thought seven years the utmost that passed between
the two works.&nbsp; Colombo shows that by 1528 Gaudenzio was
already established at Vercelli, and ascribes the frescoes in the
Magi chapel to a date some time between 1536 and 1539, during
which time he believes that Gaudenzio returned to Varallo,
finding no trace of him elsewhere.&nbsp; The internal evidence in
support of this opinion is strong, for the Crucifixion chapel is
not a greater advance upon the frescoes in the church of St.
Maria delle Grazie, painted in 1513, magnificent as these last
are, than the Magi frescoes are upon the Crucifixion, and an
interval of ten years or so is not too much to allow between the
two.&nbsp; Gaudenzio Ferrari was like Giovanni Bellini, a slow
but steady grower from first to last; with no two painters can we
be more sure that as long as they lived they were taking pains,
and going on from good to better; nevertheless, it takes many
years before so wide a difference can be brought about, as that
between the frescoes in the Magi and Crucifixion chapels.&nbsp;
The Magi frescoes have, however, unfortunately suffered from damp
much more than the Crucifixion ones, and I should say they had
been a good deal retouched, but by a very capable artist.</p>
<p>Colombo thinks that in these frescoes Gaudenzio was assisted
by his son Gerolamo, who died in 1539, and, as I have said, holds
that it was the death of this son which made him leave Varallo,
without even finishing the frescoes on which he was engaged.</p>
<p>But Signor Arienta assures me that the frescoes were not in
reality left incomplete: he holds that the wall on the parts
where the outline shows was too dry when the colour was laid on,
and that it has gradually gone, leaving the outline only.&nbsp;
This, he tells me, not unfrequently happens, and has occurred in
one or two places even in the Crucifixion chapel, where an arm
here and there appears unfinished.&nbsp; The parts in the Magi
chapel that show the outline only are not likely to have been
left to the last; they come in a very random haphazard way, and I
have little hesitation in accepting Signor Arienta&rsquo;s
opinion.&nbsp; If, however, this is wrong and the work was really
unfinished, I should ascribe this fact to the violent dissensions
that broke out in 1538, and should incline towards using it as an
argument for assigning this date to the frescoes themselves, more
especially as it fits in with whatever other meagre evidence we
have.</p>
<p>Something went wrong with the funds destined for the erection
of this chapel, and this may account for the length of time taken
to erect the chapel itself, as well as for subsequent delay in
painting it and filling it with statues.&nbsp; In the earlier
half of his work Fassola says that certain Milanese gentlemen,
&ldquo;<i>Signori della Castellanza</i>,&rdquo; subscribed two
hundred gold scudi with which to found the chapel, but that the
money was in part diverted to other uses&mdash;&ldquo;a
matter,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;about which I am compelled to
silence by a passage in my preface;&rdquo; this passage is the
expression of a desire to avoid giving offence; but Fassola says
the interception of the funds involved the chapel&rsquo;s
&ldquo;remaining incomplete for some time.&rdquo;&nbsp; There
seems, in fact, to have been some serious scandal in connection
with the money, about which, even after 150 years, Fassola was
unwilling to speak.</p>
<p>I would ask the reader to note in passing that in this work,
high up on the spectator&rsquo;s right, Gaudenzio has painted
some rocks with a truth which was in his time rare.&nbsp; In the
earliest painting, rocks seem to have been considered hopeless,
and were represented by a something like a mould for a jelly or
blanc-mange; yet rocks on a grey day are steady sitters, and one
would have thought the early masters would have found them among
the first things that they could do, whereas on the contrary they
were about the last to be rendered with truth and freedom by the
greatest painters.&nbsp; This was probably because rocks bored
them; they thought they could do them at any time, and were more
interested with the figures, draperies, and action.&nbsp;
Leonardo da Vinci&rsquo;s rocks, for example, are of no use to
any one, nor yet for the matter of that is any part of his
landscape&mdash;what little there is of it.&nbsp; Holbein&rsquo;s
strong hand falls nerveless before a rock or mountain side, and
even Marco Basaiti, whose landscape has hardly been surpassed by
Giovanni Bellini himself, could not treat a rock as he treated
other natural objects.&nbsp; As for Giovanni Bellini, I do not at
this moment remember to have seen him ever attempt a bit of
slate, or hard grey gritty sandstone rock.&nbsp; This is not so
with Gaudenzio, his rocks in the Magi chapel, and again in the
Piet&agrave; compartment of his fresco in the church of St. Maria
delle Grazie, at the foot of the mountain, are as good as rocks
need ever be.&nbsp; The earliest really good rocks I know are in
the small entombment by Roger Van der Weyden in our own National
Gallery.</p>
<p>Returning to the terra-cotta figures in the Magi chapel, there
is nothing about them to find fault with, but they do not arouse
the same enthusiasm as the frescoes.&nbsp; They too are sufferers
by damp and lapse of time, and a painted terra-cotta figure does
not lend itself to a dignified decay.&nbsp; The <i>disjecti
membra poet&aelig;</i> are hard to recognise if painted
terra-cotta is the medium through which inspiration has been
communicated to the outer world.&nbsp; Outside the Magi chapel,
invisible by the Magi, and under a small glazed lantern which
lights the St. Joseph with the Virgin adoring the Infant Saviour,
and the Presepio, hangs the star.&nbsp; It is very pretty where
it is, but its absence from the chapel itself is, I think, on the
whole, regrettable.&nbsp; I have been sometimes tempted to think
that it originally hung on the wall by a hook which still remains
near the door through which the figures must pass, but think it
more probable that this hook was used to fasten the string of a
curtain that was hung over the window.</p>
<p>In conclusion, I should say that Colombo says that the figures
being short of the prescribed number were completed by Fermo
Stella.&nbsp; Bordiga gives the horses only to this artist.</p>
<h3><span class="smcap">Chapel No</span>. 6.&nbsp; <span
class="smcap">Il Presepio</span>.</h3>
<p>This is more a grotto than a chapel, and is declared in an
inscription set up by Bernardino Caimi in letters of gold to be
&ldquo;the exact counterpart of the one at Bethlehem in which the
Virgin gave birth to her Divine Son.&rdquo;&nbsp; Bordiga writes
of this inscription as still visible, but I have repeatedly
looked for it without success.</p>
<p>If Caimi, as Fassola distinctly says, had the above
inscription set up, it is plain that this, and perhaps the
Shepherd&rsquo;s chapel hard by, were among the very earliest
chapels undertaken.&nbsp; This is rendered probable by the
statement of Fassola that the shell of the Circumcision chapel
which adjoins the ones we are now considering was built
&ldquo;<i>dalli principij del Sacro Monte</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp; He
says that this fact is known by the testimony of certain
contemporaneous painters (&ldquo;<i>il che s&rsquo; argumenta
dalli Pittori che furono di que&rsquo; tempi</i>&rdquo;).&nbsp;
Clearly, then, the Presepio, Shepherds, and Circumcision chapels
were in existence some years before the Magi chapel was
begun.&nbsp; Gaudenzio was too young to have done the figures
before Bernardino died.&nbsp; Originally, doubtless, the grotto
was shown without figures, which were added by Gaudenzio, later
on; they were probably among his first works.&nbsp; The place is
so dark that they cannot be well seen, but about noon the sun
comes down a narrow staircase and they can be made out very well
for a quarter of an hour or so; they are then seen to be very
good.&nbsp; They have no fresco background, nor yet is there any
to the Shepherd&rsquo;s chapel, which confirms me in thinking
these to have been among the earliest works undertaken.&nbsp;
Colombo says that the infant Christ in the Presepio is not by
Gaudenzio, the original figure having been stolen by some
foreigner not many years ago, and Battista, the excellent Custode
of the Sacro Monte, assures me that this was the second time the
infant had been stolen.</p>
<h3><span class="smcap">Chapel No</span>. 7.&nbsp; <span
class="smcap">Visit of the Shepherds</span>.</h3>
<p>Some of the figures&mdash;the Virgin, one shepherd, and four
little angels&mdash;in this chapel are believed to be by
Gaudenzio, and if they are, they are probably among his first
essays, but they are lighted from above, and the spectator looks
down on them, so that the dust shows, and they can hardly be
fairly judged.&nbsp; The hindmost shepherd&mdash;the one with his
hand to his heart and looking up, is the finest figure; the
Virgin herself is also very good, but she wants washing.</p>
<p>If Fassola and Torrotti are to be believed, <a
name="citation140"></a><a href="#footnote140"
class="citation">[140]</a> and I am afraid I must own that, much
as I like them, I find them a little credulous, the Virgin in
this chapel is more remarkable than she appears at first sight;
she used originally to have her face turned in admiration towards
the infant Christ, but at the very first moment that she heard
the bells begin to ring for the elevation of Pope Innocent the
Tenth to the popedom, she turned round to the pilgrims visiting
the place, in token of approbation; the authorities, not knowing
what to make of such behaviour, had her set right, but she turned
round a second time with a most gracious smile and assumed the
position which the elevation of no later Pope has been ever able
to disturb.&nbsp; Pope Innocent X. was not exactly the kind of
Pope whom one would have expected the Virgin to greet with such
extraordinary condescension.&nbsp; If it had been the present
amiable and venerable Pontiff there would have been less to
wonder at.</p>
<h3><span class="smcap">Chapel No</span>. 8.&nbsp; <span
class="smcap">Called by Fassola and Torrotti the Circumcision,
and by Bordiga the Purification</span>.</h3>
<p>The chapel itself is, as I have already said, one of the very
oldest on the Sacro Monte; it is doubtless much older than either
the frescoes or the terra-cotta figures which it contains, both
of which are given by Fassola, Torrotti, and Bordiga to Fermo
Stella, but I cannot think they are right in either case.&nbsp;
The frescoes remind me more of Lanini, and are much too modern
for Fermo Stella; they are, however, in but poor preservation,
and no very definite opinion can be formed concerning them.&nbsp;
The terra-cotta work is, I think, also too free for Fermo
Stella.&nbsp; The infant Jesus is very pretty, and the Virgin
would also be a fine figure if she was not spoiled by the wig and
over-much paint which restorers have doubtless got to answer
for.&nbsp; The work is mentioned in the 1586 edition of Caccia as
completed, but there is nothing to show whether or no it was a
restoration.&nbsp; I have long thought I detected a certain
sub-Flemish feeling in both the Virgin and Child, and though
aware that I have very little grounds for doing so, am half
inclined to think that Tabachetti must have had something to do
with them.&nbsp; Bordiga is clearly wrong in calling the chapel a
Purification.&nbsp; There are no doves, and there must always be
doves for a Purification.&nbsp; Besides, there was till lately a
knife ready for use lying on the table, as shown in
Guidetti&rsquo;s illustration of the chapel.</p>
<h3><span class="smcap">Chapel No</span>. 9.&nbsp; <span
class="smcap">Joseph Warned to Fly</span>.</h3>
<p>This chapel is described as completed in both the 1586 and
1590 editions of Caccia.&nbsp; The figures are again given to
Fermo Stella by Bordiga, but not by either Fassola or
Torrotti.&nbsp; I am again unable to think that Bordiga is
right.&nbsp; There is again, also, a sub-Flemish feeling which is
difficult to account for.&nbsp; The angel is a fine figure, and
the heads of the Virgin and Child are also excellent, but the
folds of the drapery are not so good.&nbsp; If there were any
evidence, which there is not, to show that these figures were
early works of Tabachetti, and that the sleeping St. Joseph is a
first attempt at the figure which he succeeded later so admirably
in rendering, I should be inclined to accept it; as it is, I can
form no opinion about the authorship of the terra-cotta
work.&nbsp; The fresco background is worthless.</p>
<h3><span class="smcap">Chapel No</span>. 10.&nbsp; <span
class="smcap">The Flight into Egypt</span>.</h3>
<p>This chapel is of no great interest.&nbsp; The authors and the
date are uncertain.&nbsp; It is mentioned in the 1586 and 1590
editions of Caccia, but we may be tolerably sure that Tabachetti
had nothing to do with it.&nbsp; Bordiga says &ldquo;the figures
seem to be by Stella,&rdquo; which may be right or may be
wrong.&nbsp; Though the figures are not very good, yet this
chapel has, or had in Fassola&rsquo;s time, other merits perhaps
even of greater than artistic value, for he says it is
particularly useful to those who have lost anything.&nbsp;
&ldquo;<i>Perditori di qualche cosa</i>&rdquo; are more especial
recipients of grace in consequence of devotion at this particular
chapel.&nbsp; The flight is conducted as leisurely as flights
into Egypt invariably are, but has with it a something, I know
not what&mdash;perhaps it is the donkey&mdash;which always
reminds me of Hampstead Heath on a bank holiday.</p>
<h3><span class="smcap">Chapel No</span>.&nbsp; 11.&nbsp; <span
class="smcap">Massacre of the Innocents</span>.</h3>
<p>This is one of the most remarkable chapels on the Sacro Monte,
and also one of the most abounding in difficult problems.&nbsp;
It was built with funds provided by Carlo Emanuele I., Duke of
Savoy, about the year 1586, and took four years to
complete.&nbsp; In the 1586&ndash;7 edition of Caccia the chapel
itself is alone given as completed.&nbsp; In the 1590&ndash;1
edition, it is said that both the sculptures and the frescoes
were now finished, and that they are all &ldquo;<i>bellissime e
ben fatti</i> (<i>sic</i>).&rdquo;&nbsp; This is confirmed by an
inscription on the collar of a soldier who stands near
Herod&rsquo;s right hand, and which, I do not doubt, is intended
to govern the whole of the terra-cotta work.&nbsp; The
inscription runs&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Michel Ang.&nbsp; RSTI&rdquo; (Rossetti)
&ldquo;Scul: Da Claino MDXC&nbsp; Etate an. VIIL&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This exactly tallies with the dates given in the two editions
of Caccia.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">

 src="images/p144s.jpg" />
</a></p>
<p>The date is thus satisfactorily established, but the
authorship of the work is less easily settled.&nbsp; All the
authorities without exception say that the sculptor was a certain
Giacomo Bargnola of Valsolda, who was also called Bologna.&nbsp;
Fassola describes him as a &ldquo;<i>statuario virtuosissimo e
glorioso per tutta l&rsquo; Europa</i>,&rdquo; and Torrotti calls
him &ldquo;<i>il famoso Giacomo Bargnola di Valsoldo</i> [sic]
<i>sopranominato Bologna</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp; All subsequent writers
have repeated this.</p>
<p>At Varallo itself I found nothing known about either Bargnola
or Valsolda, but turning to Zani find Bargnola under the name
Paracca.&nbsp; Zani says, &ldquo;<i>Paracca</i>, <i>non
Peracca</i>, <i>n&egrave; Perracca</i>, <i>n&egrave;
Perrazza</i>, <i>Giannantonio</i>, <i>o Giacomo</i>, <i>detto il
Valsoldo</i>, <i>Valsolino</i>, <i>e il Valsoldino</i>, <i>non
Valfondino</i>, <i>ed anche il Bargnola</i>, <i>e malamente
Antonio Valsado Parravalda</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp; He says that he was
a &ldquo;<i>plastico</i>&rdquo; and restorer of statues, came
from the neighbourhood of Como, was
&ldquo;<i>bravissimo</i>,&rdquo; and lived about from
1557&ndash;1587.&nbsp; There was a Luigi Paracca from the same
place who was also called &ldquo;Il Valsoldino&rdquo; and a
Giacomo, and an Andrea, but of these last three he does not say
that they were noteworthy.</p>
<p>Nagler mentions only a Giovanni Antonio Parracca, who he says
was called Valsolda.&nbsp; He says that he was a sculptor of
Milan, who made a reputation at Rome about 1580 as a restorer of
antique statues; that he only worked in order to get money to
spend on debauchery, and died, according to Baglione, young, and
in a hospital.&nbsp; His words are&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Paracca, Gio. Antonio gennant Valsoldo,
Bildhauer von Mailand, machte sich um 1580 in Rom als Restaurator
antiker Werke einen Namen, arbeitete aber nur, um Geld zur
Schwelgerei zu bekommen.&nbsp; Starb jung im Hospital wie
Baglione versichert.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I have had Baglione before me, but can find no life of Paracca
either under that name or under that of Bargnola, and suppose the
reference to him must be incidental in the life of some other
artist.&nbsp; I will again gratefully accept a fuller
reference.&nbsp; I do not believe a word about Paracca&rsquo;s
alleged debauchery.&nbsp; Who ever yet worked as Nagler says?</p>
<p>We have, then, to face on the one hand the authority of all
writers about the Sacro Monte, and on the other, the exceedingly
explicit claim made by Rossetti himself in the inscription given
above.&nbsp; Probably Bargnola began the work and Rossetti
finished it.&nbsp; It is not likely that the extremely
circumstantial statement of Fassola should be without any
foundation, but again it is not likely that Rossetti would have
claimed the work if he had not done at any rate the greater part
of it.&nbsp; If Bargnola died about 1587, he could not have done
much, for in the 1586&ndash;1587 edition of Caccia it is
expressly stated that the chapel alone was done &ldquo;<i>Di
questa &egrave; fatta solamente la chiesa</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp; And
if he had lived to finish the work, he, and not Rossetti, would
have signed it.&nbsp; We may conclude, then, with some certainty,
that he died before the chapel was finished, but may think it
nevertheless probable that he was originally commissioned to do
it.</p>
<p>The question resolves itself, therefore, into how much he did,
and how soon Rossetti took the work over.&nbsp; It must be
remembered that Michael Angelo Rossetti is a name absolutely
unknown to us.&nbsp; Zani, Nagler, Cicognara, L&uuml;bke,
Perkins, and all the authorities I have consulted omit to mention
him.&nbsp; I find abundant reference to three, and indeed five,
painters who were called Rossetti, two of whom&mdash;doubtless
nephews of Michael Angelo Rossetti,&mdash;did the frescoes in
this very chapel we are considering, but no one says one syllable
about any Michael Angelo Rossetti, and it is a bold thing to
suppose that an unknown man should have succeeded so admirably
with such a very important work as the Massacre of the Innocents
chapel, and have lived as the inscription shows to the age at
least of fifty-seven without leaving a single trace in any other
quarter whatever.</p>
<p>The work, at any rate in many parts, is that of one who has
been working in clay all his life, and was a thorough master of
his craft, and this makes it all the more difficult to suppose it
to be a single <i>tour de force</i>.&nbsp; On the other hand,
such <i>tours de force</i> were not uncommon among medieval
Italian workmen.&nbsp; Gaudenzio Ferrari&rsquo;s work in
sculpture is little else than a succession of <i>tours de
force</i>, and in other parts of the work we are now considering,
there is a certain archaism which suggests growing rather than
matured power.</p>
<p>We should not forget, however, that an inscription in
terra-cotta cannot be surreptitiously scrawled on like a false
signature on a fresco or painting.&nbsp; Here the signature was
made with pomp and circumstance while the clay was still wet, and
was baked with the figure on which it appears.&nbsp; Too many
people in this case would have to know about it for a false
inscription to be probable.&nbsp; As for the evidence of Fassola,
we must bear in mind that he is a notoriously inaccurate writer;
that he did not write till nearly a hundred years after the work
was completed; that Torrotti is only an echo of Fassola, and all
subsequent writers little more than echoes of Fassola and
Torrotti.&nbsp; On the whole, therefore, the more I have
considered the matter the more I incline towards accepting the
signature, and giving the greater part of the terra-cotta work to
the man who claims it&mdash;that is to say, to Michael Angelo
Rossetti, sculptor, of Claino.&nbsp; Signor Arienta tells me he
has found a Castel Claino mentioned in an old document, as
formerly existing near Milan.&nbsp; He is himself inclined
(though knowing nothing of Paracca when I last saw him), to see
two hands in the work&mdash;and here he is probably right, but I
hardly think Rossetti would have signed as he did if Bargnola or
Paracca had done the greater part or even half of it.</p>
<p>Proceeding to a consideration of the frescoes, we find that
two of Herod&rsquo;s body-guard, standing on his left hand, and
corresponding to the one on his right, on whose collar the
sculptor signed his name, have also signatures on their collars,
obviously done in concert with the sculptor.&nbsp; The signatures
are as follows:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Battista Roveri Pictor Milane &AElig;ta
XXXV&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>and</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Io Mauro Rover Pictor.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Fassola says that the painter of the chapel was &ldquo;il
Fiamenghino.&rdquo;&nbsp; If he had said the painters were
&ldquo;i Fiamenghini&rdquo; he would have been right, for Signor
Arienta called my attention to a passage in Lanzi, in which he
has dealt with three painters bearing the name of Rovere, two of
whom, if not all three, were called &ldquo;i
Fiamenghini.&rdquo;&nbsp; The three were Giovanni Mauro,
Giambattista, and Marco, which last painter does not seem to have
had anything to do with the Massacre of the Innocents.&nbsp;
Lanzi calls Gio. Mauro a follower, first of Camillo, and then of
Giulio Cesare Procaccini.&nbsp; He describes them as painters of
great facility and invention, but as seldom taking pains to do
what they very well might have done, if they had chosen, and his
verdict is, I should say, about right.&nbsp; He adds:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;I find them also called Rossetti, and they
are still more often described as &lsquo;<i>i
Fiamenghini</i>,&rsquo; their father, Richard, having come from
Flanders, and settled in Milan.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Signor Arienta explained to me that it was through this
surname of Fiamenghini, by which the brothers Rovere were known,
that Giovanni Miel D&rsquo;Anvers was supposed to have had any
hand in the frescoes on the Sacro Monte.&nbsp; This last-named
painter was court painter to Carlo Emanuelle I.&nbsp; Bordiga
knew this, and seeing he came from Antwerp, concluded that he
must be &ldquo;il Fiamenghino&rdquo; mentioned, and all
subsequent writers have followed him.</p>
<p>Signor Arienta also tells me that some twenty years or so
later these same two painters signed some frescoes at Orta as
follows:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Io Battista, et Io Maurus Aruberius, dicti
Fiamenghini, pinxerunt anno 1608 die 9 Octobris.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Doubtless their mother&rsquo;s name was Rossetti, and the
Michael Angelo RSTI who claims the sculptured work, and was some
twenty years their senior, was their uncle.</p>
<p>He also told me that one of the figures in the frescoes of the
Massacre of the Innocents chapel is wearing a collar with a clasp
on which there is an oak-tree, for which &ldquo;Rovere&rdquo; is
the Italian, and that he holds this to have been a portrait of
the painter.</p>
<p>Fassola says that under the glazed aperture which is in front
of the piece there is placed a small terra-cotta car drawn by a
child and loaded with a head, or ear, of maize, a goose, and a
clown; he explains that the maize means 1000, the car 400, the
clown 90, and the goose &ldquo;<i>per il suo
verso</i>&rdquo;&mdash;whatever this may mean&mdash;4, which
numbers taken together make the number of infants that were
killed.&nbsp; He adds that there is another like hieroglyphic,
which, as it is not very important, he will pass over.&nbsp; I
find no mention of this in Torrotti, nor yet in Bordiga, but when
people call attention to a thing and then say nothing about it, I
generally find they have a reason.&nbsp; On a recent visit to
Varallo I examined the two hieroglyphs; the second is also a
small terra-cotta car or cart drawn by a child, and containing
the bust of a monk, a die, and two or three other things that I
could not make out.&nbsp; The treatment of these two
hieroglyphics alone is enough to show that they were done by a
thorough master of his craft.&nbsp; No doubt the import of the
whole was known by Fassola to be sinister, but I must leave its
interpretation to others.&nbsp; He adds that the graces
vouchsafed at this chapel are chiefly on behalf of sick
children.</p>
<p>I may conclude by saying that though nothing has been taken
directly from Tabachetti&rsquo;s Journey to Calvary chapel, the
sculptor, whoever he was, has nevertheless plainly felt the
influence, and been animated by the spirit of that great work,
then just completed.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">We</span> now begin the series of chapels
that deal with Christ&rsquo;s Manhood, Ministry, and
Passion.&nbsp; The first of these is</p>
<h3><span class="smcap">Chapel No</span>. 12.&nbsp; <span
class="smcap">The Baptism of Christ by John</span>.</h3>
<p>The statues are of no great interest, and of unknown
authorship.&nbsp; The frescoes are by Orazio Gallinone di
Treviglio, but they are not striking.&nbsp; The date of the
chapel is about 1585.&nbsp; It is mentioned in the 1586 edition
of Caccia, and it is added that the water of the fountain would
be brought there shortly so as to imitate the Jordan.&nbsp; This
was done, but the water made the chapel so damp that it was
turned off again.&nbsp; The graces, according to Fassola, are
chiefly for married ladies.</p>
<h3><span class="smcap">Chapel No</span>. 13.&nbsp; <span
class="smcap">Temptation</span>.</h3>
<p>This chapel is given as completed in the 1586 edition of
Caccia, and had probably been by this time reconstructed by
Tabachetti, to whom the work is universally and no doubt justly
ascribed.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">

</a></p>
<p>That the figures of Christ and of the devil have both been cut
about may be conjectured from their draperies being in part real
linen or calico, and not terra-cotta; Christ&rsquo;s red shirt
front is real, as also is a great part of the devil&rsquo;s
dress.&nbsp; This last personage is a most respectable-looking
patriarchal old Jewish Rabbi.&nbsp; I should say he was the
leading solicitor in some such town as Samaria, and that he gave
an annual tea to the choir.&nbsp; He is offering Christ some
stones just as any other respectable person might do, and if it
were not for his formidable two clawed feet there would be
nothing to betray his real nature.&nbsp; The beasts with their
young are excellent.&nbsp; The porcupine has real quills.&nbsp;
The fresco background is by Melchior D&rsquo;Enrico, and here the
fall of the devil when the whole is over is treated with a
realistic unreserve little likely to be repeated.&nbsp; He is
dreadfully unwell.&nbsp; The graces in this chapel are more
especially for those tempted by the world, the flesh, and the
devil, for people who are bewitched, and for those who are in any
wise troubled in mind, body, and estate, &ldquo;as the varying
views of the pilgrims themselves will best determine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bordiga says that the chapel was begun about 1580, and
completed in 1594, but he refers probably to Tabachetti&rsquo;s
reconstruction, for in the portico there is an inscription
painted by order of the Bishop, and forbidding visitors to deface
the walls, that is dated 1524, and the back of the chapel has
many early 16th century scratches.</p>
<h3><span class="smcap">Chapel No</span>. 14.&nbsp; <span
class="smcap">The Woman of Samaria</span>.</h3>
<p>This chapel is given as completed in the 1586 edition of
Caccia, so that Bordiga and Cusa are wrong in dating it
1598.&nbsp; In the poetical part of Caccia it is described as
recently made and &ldquo;<i>ben ritratto</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp; The
woman of Samaria is a fine buxom figure, but the paint has peeled
off so badly both from her and from the Christ that it is hardly
fair to judge the work at all.&nbsp; I should think it was very
possibly an early work by Tabachetti, but should be sorry to
hazard a decided opinion.&nbsp; The frescoes are without
interest.&nbsp; The graces at this chapel were chiefly for women
who wanted to abandon some evil practice, and for rain when the
country was suffering from long drought.&nbsp; This last is
because Christ said to the woman of Samaria &ldquo;Give me to
drink.&rdquo;</p>
<h3><span class="smcap">Chapel No</span>. 15.&nbsp; <span
class="smcap">The Paralytic</span>.</h3>
<p>The chapel alone was completed by 1586 and 1590, so that we
may be certain Tabachetti had no hand in it.&nbsp; The statues
are said to be by D&rsquo;Enrico, whom we meet here for the first
time.&nbsp; Bordiga praises them very highly, but neither Jones
nor I liked the composition as much as we should have wished to
have done.&nbsp; Some of the individual figures are good,
especially a man with his arm in a sling, and two men conversing
on the left of the composition, but there is too little concerted
and united action, and too much attempt to show off every figure
to the best advantage, to the sacrifice of more important
considerations.&nbsp; They probably date from 1620&ndash;1624, in
which last year Bordiga says that the frescoes were
completed.&nbsp; These are chiefly, if not entirely, by
Cristoforo Martinolo, a Valsesian artist and pupil of Morazzone,
who, according to Bordiga, though little known, has here shown
himself no common artist.&nbsp; Again neither Jones nor I admired
them as much as we should have been glad to do.&nbsp; &ldquo;All
infirmities of fever, and paralysis,&rdquo; says Fassola,
&ldquo;if recommended to the Great Saviour at this place will be
dissipated, as may be gathered from the many <i>voti</i> here
exhibited.&rdquo;</p>
<h3><span class="smcap">Chapel No</span>. 16.&nbsp; <span
class="smcap">The Widow&rsquo;s Son at Nain</span>.</h3>
<p>Of this chapel the walls are alone mentioned as completed in
1590.&nbsp; So that Bordiga and Cusa are again wrong in saying
that the frescoes were painted about 1580.&nbsp; It is not
good.&nbsp; The walls were probably raised soon after 1580.&nbsp;
Donna Mathilde di Savoia, Marchesa di Pianezza, a natural
daughter of Carlo Emmanuele I., was among the principal
contributors.&nbsp; The graces were &ldquo;for those who had had
bad falls or any accidents whereby they had been rendered
speechless, stupid, senseless, and apparently dead.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It will be observed on referring to the plan facing p. 68,
that this chapel is given as on the ground now occupied by Christ
taken before Annas, and faces the Herod chapel on the Piazza dei
Tribunali.&nbsp; This may be a mere error in the plan, but the
plan is generally accurate, and it is very likely that a change
was made in the middle of the last century when the Annas chapel
was built.</p>
<h3><span class="smcap">Chapel No</span>. 17.&nbsp; <span
class="smcap">The Transfiguration</span>.</h3>
<p>This is on the highest ground of the Sacro Monte, the
Transfiguration being supposed to have happened on Mount
Sinai.&nbsp; Inside the chapel they have made Mount Sinai, but
Fassola says that it was originally quite too high, and the
Fabbricieri had ordered it to be made lower, &ldquo;so as to
render it more enjoyable by the eye.&rdquo;&nbsp; It was begun at
the end of the sixteenth century, but is mentioned as being only
&ldquo;founded&rdquo; in the 1586 and 1590 editions of Caccia,
and the work seems to have got little further than the
foundations, until in 1660 it was resumed; Fassola, writing in
1671, says that the chapel was &ldquo;<i>levata in alto da terra
l&rsquo;anno del mille</i>, <i>sei cento e sessanta</i>,&rdquo;
or about ten years before his book appeared; it was still in
great part unpainted, and he makes an appeal to his readers to
contribute towards its completion.&nbsp; From both Fassola and
Torrotti it would appear that only the group of figures on the
mountain was in existence when they wrote.&nbsp; They both of
them make the extraordinary statement that these figures are by
Giovanni D&rsquo;Enrico, whom they must have perfectly well known
to have been dead more than a quarter of a century before Fassola
wrote, and many years before the figures could possibly have been
placed where they now are.&nbsp; It is much as though I, writing
now, were to ascribe Boehm&rsquo;s statue of Mr. Darwin, in the
Natural History Museum at South Kensington, to Chantrey.&nbsp;
The figures on the mountain are among the worst on the Sacro
Monte.&nbsp; I see that Cusa ascribes the figures of Peter,
James, and John only to D&rsquo;Enrico, but the ascription is
very difficult to understand.</p>
<p>Bordiga does not say who did the figures of Peter, James, and
John, but he gives the Christ, Moses, and Elias to Pietro
Francesco Petera of Varallo.&nbsp; The fourteen figures at the
foot of the mountain he assigns to Gaudenzio Soldo of Camasco, a
pupil of the sculptor Dionigi Bussola.&nbsp; In 1665 Giuseppe and
Stefano Danedi, called Montalti, and pupils of Morazzone,
&ldquo;painted the cupola of the chapel with innumerable angels
great and small exhibiting the most varied
movements.&rdquo;&nbsp; Giuseppe had the greater share in this
work, in which may be seen, according to Bordiga, signs of the
influence of Guido, under whom Giuseppe had studied.</p>
<p>Among the figures below the mountain there is a blind man, and
a boy with a bad foot leading him&mdash;both good&mdash;and a
contemptuous father telling the Apostles that they cannot cure
his son, and that he had told them so from the first, but the
paint is peeling off the figures so much that the work can hardly
be judged fairly.&nbsp; When photographed they look much better,
and Signor Pizetta tells me he was last year commissioned to
photograph the boy, who is in a fit of hystero-epilepsy, for a
medical work that was being published in France, so it is
probably very true to nature.</p>
<h3><span class="smcap">Chapel No</span>. 18.&nbsp; <span
class="smcap">Raising of Lazarus</span>.</h3>
<p>Fassola says that this chapel was erected at the expense of
Pomponio Bosso, a noble Milanese, between the years 1560 and
1580.&nbsp; It is mentioned as finished in the 1586 edition of
Caccia, and was probably completed before Tabachetti came.&nbsp;
Bordiga only says that it was finished in 1582.&nbsp; The statues
are of little or no merit, nor yet the frescoes.&nbsp; I observe
that in Caccia the &ldquo;tempio&rdquo; is praised but not
apparently the work that it contained.&nbsp; The terra-cotta
figures are ascribed by Bordiga to Ravello, and the frescoes to
Testa, whose brother, Lorenzo Testa, was Fabbriciere at the time
the chapel was erected.&nbsp; There is one rather nice little man
in the left-hand corner, but there is nothing else.</p>
<h3><span class="smcap">Chapel No</span>. 19.&nbsp; <span
class="smcap">Entry into Jerusalem</span>.</h3>
<p>The figures in this chapel are ascribed to Giovanni
D&rsquo;Enrico by both Fassola and Torrotti, an ascription very
properly set aside by Bordiga, without assigned reason, but
probably because 1590 is considerably too early for Giovanni
D&rsquo;Enrico, and there is a document dated May 23, 1590,
showing that the fresco background was then contracted for.&nbsp;
The sculptured figures are mentioned as finished in the 1586
edition of Caccia, so that D&rsquo;Enrico could not have done
them.&nbsp; They are better than those in the preceding chapels,
but they do not arouse enthusiasm, and have suffered so much from
decay, and from repainting, that it is hardly fair to form any
opinion about them.&nbsp; They probably looked much better when
new.&nbsp; The landscape part of the background is by one of the
brothers Rovere, named, as I have said, Fiamenghini, and he has
introduced a house with a stepped gable like those at
Antwerp.&nbsp; Some of the figures in the background appear to be
by the painter Testa, who is named in the document above referred
to.</p>
<h3><span class="smcap">Chapel No.</span> 20.&nbsp; <span
class="smcap">The Last Supper</span>.</h3>
<p>This was one of the earliest chapels, and is mentioned as
completed in the 1586 edition of Caccia.&nbsp; The figures are of
wood, stiff, and lifeless, the supper is profuse and of much
later date than the figures, but the whole scene is among the
least successful on the Sacro Monte.&nbsp; Originally, but not
till many years after the figures had been made and placed,
Lanini painted a fresco background for this chapel.&nbsp; Perhaps
Gaudenzio brought him from Vercelli on the occasion of the
temporary return to Varallo supposed by Colombo to have taken
place between 1536 and 1539.&nbsp; If we could know when Lanini
was on the Sacro Monte doing this background, we might suspect
that Gaudenzio was not far off.&nbsp; Lanini&rsquo;s work has
unfortunately perished in a second reconstruction of the
chapel.&nbsp; Torrotti in 1686 says that a reconstruction of the
Cena chapel was then contemplated, but that Lanini&rsquo;s
frescoes were not to be touched.&nbsp; The original Cena chapel
may or may not have been on its present site, but the first
restoration certainly was so, as appears from the plan dated 1671
already given.&nbsp; The apostles have real napkins round their
shoulders.&nbsp; The graces are for people who feel themselves
deficient in faith, and intercession may be made here for
obstinate sinners.</p>
<h3><span class="smcap">Chapel No</span>. 21.&nbsp; <span
class="smcap">The Agony in the Garden</span>.</h3>
<p>This chapel, again, has been reconstructed, but the old
figures have not been preserved as in the case of the Cena, nor
yet has the original site.&nbsp; The original site, according to
Bordiga, was apart from the other chapels at the foot of the
neighbouring <i>monticello</i>, meaning, presumably, the height
on which the Transfiguration chapel now stands.&nbsp; It was at
this old chapel that S. Carlo used to spend hours in
prayer.&nbsp; It was one of the earliest, and the figures were of
wood.&nbsp; Fassola says that it was the angel who was offering
the cup to Christ in the old chapel who announced his approaching
end to S. Carlo, but the figures had been removed in his time as
they were perishing, and the terra-cotta ones by Giovanni
D&rsquo;Enrico had been substituted, with a fresco background by
his brother Melchiorre.&nbsp; These in their turn perished during
a reconstruction some twenty years or so ago.&nbsp; The graces at
this chapel are thus described by Fassola.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Il moderno e Christo ed Angiolo nel medemo
stato rinouati non sono meno miraculosi, perche tutti li
concorrenti, bisognosi di pazienza di soffrire trauagli,
malattie, ed ogni sorte d&rsquo; infermit&agrave; tanto
dell&rsquo; anima, quanto del corpo caldamente racomandandosi al
piacere di questo sudante Christo riportano ci&ograve; che meglio
per lo stato di questo, ed altro Mondo f&agrave; di
necessit&agrave; alle loro persone.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I find no mention of any original fresco background, though I
do of the one added afterwards by Melchiorre D&rsquo;Enrico, now
no longer in existence.&nbsp; As this was one of the earliest
chapels, I incline to think that there was no fresco background
in the first instance.</p>
<h3><span class="smcap">Chapel No</span>. 22.&nbsp; <span
class="smcap">The Sleeping Apostles</span>.</h3>
<p>Fassola says that this chapel was decorated about fifty years
(really fifty-nine) before the date at which he was writing, by
Melchiorre D&rsquo;Enrico.&nbsp; It was then on its present site,
but the end of the Cena block was rebuilt some twenty years
ago.&nbsp; The present Custode, Battista, tells me he worked at
the rebuilding, and taking me upstairs showed me a trace or two
of Melchiorre&rsquo;s background.&nbsp; The sleeping Apostles are
said to be by Giovanni D&rsquo;Enrico; they will not bear
comparison with Tabachetti&rsquo;s St. Joseph.&nbsp; The
benefactor was Count Pio Giacomo Fassola di Rassa, a collateral
ancestor of the historian.&nbsp; People who have become lethargic
in their self-indulgence, or who are blinded through some bad
habit, will find relief at this chapel.&nbsp; I have met with
nothing to show that there was any earlier chapel with the same
subject, and in the 1586 edition of Caccia it is expressly
mentioned as one of those that as yet were merely contemplated,
though the Agony in the Garden itself is described as
completed.</p>

166</span>CHAPTER XII.<br />
<span class="GutSmall"><i>THE PALACE OF PILATE</i></span><span
class="GutSmall">.</span></h2>
<p><span class="smcap">We</span> now come to the block of several
chapels comprised in a building originally designed by Pellegrini
at the instance of S. Carlo Borromeo, but not carried out
according to his design, and called &ldquo;The Palace of
Pilate.&rdquo;&nbsp; This work was begun about 1590, and
according to Fassola was not completed till 1660.&nbsp; The
figures, however, must have been most of them placed by 1644, for
they are mainly by Giovanni D&rsquo;Enrico, who is believed to
have died in that year.&nbsp; The first of these
chapels&mdash;the Capture of Christ&mdash;and probably several
others, comprise some figures taken from earlier chapels.&nbsp;
Fassola says that before this building was erected, the old
portico built by Milano Scarrognini stood in the Piazza in front
of the Holy Sepulchre, that &ldquo;in its circuit of three
hundred paces it comprised several mysteries of the
passion.&rdquo;&nbsp; Among these were probably the present
Flagellation, Crowning with Thorns, and final Taking of Christ
before Pilate chapels.&nbsp; Each of these, however, has
undergone some modification.</p>
<h3><span class="smcap">Chapel No</span>. 23.&nbsp; <span
class="smcap">The Capture of Christ</span>.</h3>
<p>This chapel is in the Palazzo di Pilato block, though not
strictly a suffering under Pontius Pilate.&nbsp; The greater
number of the sixteen figures that it contains are old, and of
wood, and among these are the figures of Christ, Judas, and
Malchus, who is lying on the ground.&nbsp; To show how dust and
dirt accumulate in the course of centuries, I may say that Cav.
Prof. Antonini told me he had himself unburied the figure of
Malchus, which he found more than half covered with earth.&nbsp;
We have seen that there are also two figures introduced here
which had no connection with the original chapel, I mean of
course the old Adam and Eve, who are now doing duty as Roman
soldiers.&nbsp; The few remaining figures that are not of wood
are given to D&rsquo;Enrico, and the frescoes are by his brother
Melchiorre.&nbsp; Neither figures nor frescoes can be highly
praised.&nbsp; The present chapel is not on the site of the old,
which I have already explained was on the ground floor of the
large house on the visitor&rsquo;s left as he enters the smaller
entrance to the Sacro Monte.</p>
<p>The servants were put to lodge above this old and now derelict
Capture chapel when the present one was made.&nbsp; The date of
the removal is given by Cusa as 1570, who says that the Marchese
del Guasto contributed largely to the expense.&nbsp; If the
figures were then completed and arranged as we now see them,
Giovanni D&rsquo;Enrico can have had no hand in them, but it is
quite possible that somewhere about 1615&ndash;1619, they were
again rearranged and perhaps added to.&nbsp; Melchiorre
D&rsquo;Enrico has signed the frescoes in a quasi-cipher and
dated them 1619.&nbsp; The old chapel, though, I think,
originally larger than it now is, could not have contained all or
nearly all the present figures.&nbsp; Any second rearrangement of
the chapel may have been due to its incorporation in the Palazzo
di Pilato block, which we know was not begun till after
1590.&nbsp; That the removal from the original chapel had been
effected before 1586 is shown by the fact that the chapel is
given in its present geographical sequence in the edition of
Caccia published at the end of that year.&nbsp; The work contains
no trace of Tabachetti&rsquo;s hand, and this should make us
incline towards thinking that.&nbsp; Tabachetti had not yet come
to Varallo by 1570.</p>
<p>Of the former chapel Fassola says:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;On again descending where formerly was the
Capture of Christ, and near the exit [from the Sacro Monte] we
came to the porter&rsquo;s lodge.&nbsp; It should be noted that
under the porter&rsquo;s room, in the place where the Capture
used to be, there are most admirable frescoes by Gaudenzio&rdquo;
(p. 22).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>With his accustomed reticence where he fears to give offence,
he does not say that the frescoes are going to rack and ruin, but
this is what he means; Torrotti expresses himself more freely,
saying that a chapel, although derelict, containing paintings by
Gaudenzio and his pupils, should not be left to the neglect of
servants.&nbsp; These frescoes were removed a year or so ago to
the Pinacoteca in the Museum.&nbsp; They are not by Gaudenzio,
and are now rightly given to Lanini.&nbsp; They are mere
fragments, and of no great importance.</p>
<h3><span class="smcap">Chapel No</span>. 24.&nbsp; <span
class="smcap">Christ taken to Annas</span>.</h3>
<p>This is the one chapel that belongs to the 18th century,
having been finished about 1765 at the expense of certain
Valsesians residing in Turin.&nbsp; It does not belong to the
Palazzo di Pilato block, but I deal with it here to avoid
departure from the prescribed order.&nbsp; The design of the
chapel is by Morondi, and the figures by Carlantonio Tandarini,
except that of Annas, which is by Giambattista Bernesi of
Turin.&nbsp; The frescoes are of the usual drop scene,
<i>barocco</i>, academic kind, but where the damp has spared them
they form an effective background.&nbsp; The figures want
concert, and are too much spotted about so as each one to be seen
to the best advantage.&nbsp; This, as Tabachetti very well knew,
is not in the manner of living action, and the attempt to render
it on these principles is doomed to failure; nevertheless many of
Tandarini&rsquo;s individual figures are very clever, and have a
good deal of a certain somewhat exaggerated force and
character.&nbsp; I have already said that from the plan of 1671
&ldquo;The Widow&rsquo;s Son&rdquo; would seem to have been
formerly on the site of the present Annas chapel.</p>

</a></p>
<h3><span class="smcap">Chapel No</span>. 25.&nbsp; <span
class="smcap">Christ taken before Caiaphas</span>.</h3>
<p>Cusa says that this chapel, which again is not in the Palazzo
di Pilato block, adheres very closely to the design of Pellegrino
Tibaldi.&nbsp; The figures, thirty-three in number, are by
Giovanni D&rsquo;Enrico and Giacomo Ferro, and the frescoes being
dated 1642, we may think the terra-cotta work to be among the
last done by D&rsquo;Enrico on the Sacro Monte.&nbsp; The figure
of Caiaphas must be given to him, and it is hard to see how it
could have been more dramatically treated.&nbsp; Caiaphas has
stepped down from his throne, which is left vacant behind him,
and is adjuring Jesus to say whether he is the Christ the Son of
God.&nbsp; If it were not for the cobweb between the arm and the
body, the photograph which is here given might almost pass as
having been taken from life, and the character is so priest-like
that it is hard to understand how priests could have tolerated it
as they did.&nbsp; Indeed, the figure is so far finer than the
general run of Giovanni D&rsquo;Enrico&rsquo;s work, and so
infinitely superior to the four figures of Pilate in the four
Pilate chapels, that we should be tempted to give it to some
other sculptor if, happily, the Herod did not also show how great
D&rsquo;Enrico could be when he was doing his best, and if the
evidence for its having been by him were not so strong.</p>
<p>To the left of Caiaphas&rsquo;s empty throne are two standing
figures, which look as if they had been begun for figures of
Christ, but were condemned as not good enough.&nbsp; They may
perhaps be intended for Joseph and Nicodemus.&nbsp; Some few of
the other figures, which in all number thirty-three, are also
full of character, but the greater part of them do not rise above
the level of Giacomo Ferro&rsquo;s supers, and suffer from having
lost much paint; nevertheless the chapel is effective, chiefly,
doubtless, through the excellence of the Caiaphas himself, and if
we could see the work as it was when D&rsquo;Enrico left it we
should doubtless find it more effective still.</p>
<p>The frescoes are by Cristoforo Martinolo, also named
Rocca.&nbsp; They are not of remarkable excellence, but form an
efficient background, and are among the best preserved on the
Sacro Monte.&nbsp; They have also the great merit of being
legibly signed and dated.</p>
<h3><span class="smcap">Chapel No</span>. 26.&nbsp; <span
class="smcap">The Repentance of St. Peter</span>.</h3>
<p>Hard by under a portico there is a statue of St. Peter,
repentant, and over him there is a cock still crowing.&nbsp; The
figure of St. Peter, and presumably that of the cock also, are by
D&rsquo;Enrico.&nbsp; I can find nothing about the date in any
author.</p>
<p>This cock is said to have been the chief instrument in a
miracle not less noteworthy than any recorded in connection with
the Sacro Monte.&nbsp; It seems that on the 3rd of July 1653 a
certain Lorenzo Togni from Buccioleto, who had been a martyr to
intemperance for many years, came to the Sacro Monte in that
state in which martyrs to intemperance must be expected generally
to be.&nbsp; It was very early in the morning, but nevertheless
the man was drunk, though still just able to go the round of the
chapels.&nbsp; Nothing noticeable occurred till he got to the
Caiaphas chapel, but here all on a sudden, to the amazement of
the man himself, and of others who were standing near, a noise
was heard to come from up aloft in the St. Peter chapel, and it
was seen that the cock had turned round and was flapping his
wings with an expression of great severity.&nbsp; Before they had
recovered from their surprise, the bird exclaimed in a loud
voice, and with the utmost distinctness, &ldquo;Ciocc&rsquo;
anch&rsquo; anc&rsquo;uei,&rdquo; running the first two words
somewhat together, and dwelling long on the last syllable, which
is sounded like a long French &ldquo;eu&rdquo; and a French
&ldquo;i.&rdquo;&nbsp; These words I am told mean, &ldquo;Drunk
again to-day also?&rdquo; the &ldquo;anc&rsquo;uei&rdquo; being a
Piedmontese <i>patois</i> for &ldquo;ancora oggi.&rdquo;&nbsp;
The bird repeated these words three or four times over, and then
turned round on its perch, to all appearance terra cotta
again.&nbsp; The effect produced upon the drunkard was such that
he could never again be prevailed upon to touch wine, and ever
since this chapel has been the one most resorted to by people who
wish to give up drinking to excess.</p>
<p>The foregoing story is not given either in Fassola or
Torrotti, but my informant, a most intelligent person, assured me
that to this day the cocks about Varallo do not unfrequently say
&ldquo;Ciocc&rsquo; anch&rsquo;
anc&rsquo;uei&rdquo;&mdash;indeed, I have repeatedly heard them
do so with the most admirable distinctness.&nbsp; I am told that
cocks sometimes challenge, and wish to fight, well-done cocks on
crucifixes, but it is some way from this to the cock on the
crucifix beginning to crow too.&nbsp; One does not see where this
sort of thing is to end, and once terra-cotta always terra-cotta,
is a maxim that a respectable figure would on the whole do well
to lay to heart and abide by.</p>
<h3><span class="smcap">Chapel No</span>. 27.&nbsp; <span
class="smcap">Christ before Pilate</span>.</h3>
<p>The Pilate is not nearly so good as the Caiaphas in the
preceding chapel, but though there is not one single figure of
superlative excellence, this is still one of
D&rsquo;Enrico&rsquo;s best works, and the Pilate is the best of
the four Pilates.&nbsp; The nineteen figures are generally
ascribed to him; and, I should say there was less Giacomo Ferro
in this chapel than in most of D&rsquo;Enrico&rsquo;s.&nbsp;
Possibly Giacomo Ferro was not yet D&rsquo;Enrico&rsquo;s
assistant.&nbsp; The frescoes are by Antonio, or Tanzio,
D&rsquo;Enrico, but I cannot see much in them to admire.</p>
<p>The date is given by Bordiga as about 1620, but no date is
given either by Fassola or Torrotti.&nbsp; The nude figure to the
left, seated and holding a spear near the spectator, is said to
be a portrait of Tanzio, but Bordiga thinks that if we are to
look for the portrait anywhere in this composition, we should do
so in the open gallery above the gate of the Pretorium, where we
shall find a figure that has nothing to do with the story, and
represents a &ldquo;jocund-looking&rdquo; but venerable old man,
wearing a hat with a white feather in it, and like the portrait
of Melchiorre painted by himself in his Last
Judgment&mdash;presumably the one outside the church at Riva
Valdobbia.&nbsp; Bordiga adds that Melchiorre was still living in
1620, when Tanzio was at work on these frescoes.</p>
<h3><span class="smcap">Chapel No</span>. 28.&nbsp; <span
class="smcap">Christ before Herod</span>.</h3>
<p>Bordiga says that this chapel was begun in 1606, as shown by a
letter from Monsignor Bescap&egrave;, Bishop of Novara,
authorising the Fabbricieri to appropriate three hundred scudi
from the Mass chest for the purpose of erecting it, but it was
not finished until 1638.&nbsp; The statues, thirty-five in
number, are by Giovanni D&rsquo;Enrico, and the frescoes by
Tanzio, but we have no means of dating either the one or the
other accurately.</p>

</a></p>
<p>The figure of Herod is incomparably finer than any others in
the chapel, if we except those of two laughing boys on
Herod&rsquo;s left that are hardly seen till one is inside the
chapel itself.&nbsp; Take each of the figures separately and few
are good.&nbsp; As usual in D&rsquo;Enrico&rsquo;s chapels, there
is a deficiency of the <i>ensemble</i> and concert which no one
except Tabachetti seems to have been able to give in sculptured
groups containing many figures; nevertheless, the Herod and the
laughing boys atone almost for any deficiency.&nbsp; Bordiga
speaks of the frescoes in the highest terms, but I do not admire
them as I should wish to do.&nbsp; They are generally considered
as Antonio D&rsquo;Enrico&rsquo;s finest work on the Sacro
Monte.</p>
<p>The figures behind the two boys&rsquo; heads coming very
awkwardly in my photograph, my friend Mr. Gogin has kindly
painted them out for me, so as to bring the boys&rsquo; heads out
better.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Chapel No</span>. 29.&nbsp; <span
class="smcap">Christ taken back to Pilate</span>.</h3>
<p>This is supposed to be the last work of Giovanni
D&rsquo;Enrico, who, according to Durandi, died in 1644.&nbsp;
The scene comprises twenty-three terra-cotta figures, few of them
individually good, but nevertheless effective as a whole.&nbsp;
One man, the nearest but one to the spectator, must be given to
D&rsquo;Enrico, and perhaps one or two more, but the greater
number must have been done by Giacomo Ferro.&nbsp; The frescoes
were begun both by Morazzone and Antonio D&rsquo;Enrico, but
Fassola and Torrotti say that neither the one nor the other was
able to complete the work, which in their time was still
unfinished; but Doctor Morosini was going to get a really good
man to finish them without further delay.&nbsp; Eventually the
brothers Grandi of Milan came and did the Doric architecture,
while Pietro Gianoli did some sibyls, and on the facciata
&ldquo;<i>il casto Giuseppe portato da due
Angioli</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp; Gianoli signed his work and dated it
1679.&nbsp; We know, then, that in this case the sculptured
figures were placed some years before the background, as probably
also with several other chapels; and it may be assumed that
generally the terra-cotta figures preceded the
background&mdash;which was designed for them, and not they for
it, except in the case of Gaudenzio Ferrari&mdash;who probably
conceived both the round and flat work together as part of the
same design, and was thus the only artist on the Sacro Monte who
carried out the design of uniting painting and sculpture in a
single design, under the conditions which strictly it
involves.</p>
<p>In connection with this chapel both Fassola and Torrotti say
that D&rsquo;Enrico has intentionally made Christ&rsquo;s face
become smaller and smaller during each of these last scenes, as
becoming contracted through increase of suffering.&nbsp; I have
been unable to see that this is more than fancy on their
parts.</p>
<p>It is also in connection with this chapel that we discover the
true date of Fassola&rsquo;s book.&nbsp; He says that they had
been on the lookout &ldquo;during the whole <i>of last
year</i>&rdquo;&mdash;which he gives as 1669&mdash;for some one
to finish the frescoes.&nbsp; &ldquo;Now, however,&rdquo; he
continues, &ldquo;when this book is seeing light,&rdquo;
&amp;c.&nbsp; The book therefore should be seeing light in
1670.&nbsp; It is dated 1671.&nbsp; True, Fassola may have been
writing at the very end of 1670, and the book may have been
published at the beginning of 1671, but perhaps the more natural
conclusion is that the same reasons which make publishers wish to
misdate their books by a year now, made them wish to do so then,
and that though Fassola&rsquo;s book appeared at the end of 1670,
as would appear from his own words, it was nevertheless dated
1671.</p>
<h3><span class="smcap">Chapel No</span>. 30.&nbsp; <span
class="smcap">The Flagellation</span>.</h3>
<p>Torrotti and Fassola say that the Christ in this chapel, as
well as in all the others, is an actual portrait&mdash;and no
doubt an admirable one&mdash;communicated by Divine inspiration
to the many workmen and artists who worked on the Sacro
Monte.&nbsp; This, they say, may be known from two documents
contemporaneous with Christ Himself, in which His personal
appearance is fully set forth, and which seem almost to have been
written from the statues now existing at Varallo.&nbsp; The
worthy artists who made these statues were by no means given to
historical investigations, and were little likely to know
anything about the letters in question; besides, these had only
just been discovered, so that there can have been no deception or
illusion.&nbsp; Both Fassola and Torrotti give the letters in
full, and to their pages the reader who wishes to see them may be
referred.&nbsp; Fassola writes:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Hora vegga ogni diuoto se rassomigliando
queste statue al vero Christo essendo lauorate accidentalmente,
parendo da Dio sia dato alli Statuarij, e Pittori il lume della
sua Diuina Persona non si h&agrave; se non per mera sua
disposizione e diachiarazione d&rsquo;hauer quiui quasi come
rinouata, e resa pi&ugrave; commoda alla Christianit&agrave; la
sua Redenzione&rdquo; (p. 103).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The work is mentioned as completed in the 1586 edition of
Caccia&mdash;this, and the Crowning with Thorns, being the only
two that are described as completed of those that now form part
of the Palazzo di Pilato block.&nbsp; These two chapels do not in
reality, however, belong to the Palazzo di Pilato at all; they
existed long before it, and the new work was added on to
them.&nbsp; Bordiga says that &ldquo;an order of Monsignor
Bescap&egrave; relating to this chapel, and dated February 1,
1605, shows that there was as yet no plan of this part of the
Palace of Pilate.&rdquo;&nbsp; I have not seen this order, and
can only speak with diffidence, but I do not think the chapel has
been much modified since 1586, beyond the fact that Rocca, whom
we have already met with as painting in the Caiaphas chapel in
1642, at some time or another painted a new background, which is
now much injured by damp.</p>
<p>Not only does the author of the 1586 Caccia mention the
chapel, but he does it with more effusion than is usual with
him.&nbsp; He rarely says anything in praise of any but the best
work.&nbsp; I do not, therefore, think it likely that his words
refer to the original wooden figures, two of which were preserved
when the work was remodelled; these two mar the chapel now, and
when all the work was of the same calibre it cannot have kindled
any enthusiasm in a writer who appears to have known very fairly
well which were the best chapels.&nbsp; He says:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Da manigoldi, in atto acerbo e fiero,<br />
Alla colonna Christo flagellato<br />
<i>Da scultor dotto assimigliato al vero</i><br />
Di questo <a name="citation181"></a><a href="#footnote181"
class="citation">[181]</a> in un de i lati &egrave;
dimostrato,</p>
<p>E come fusse macerato e nero,<br />
D&rsquo;aspri flagelli percosso, e vergato,<br />
Di Christo il sacro corpo in ogni parte,<br />
Vi ha sculto dotto mastro in sottil arte.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I think the reconstruction of the chapel, then, and its
assumption of its present state, except that a fresco background
was added, should be assigned to some year about 1580&ndash;1585,
and am disposed to ascribe, at any rate, the figure of the man
who is binding Christ to the column to Tabachetti, who was then
working on the Sacro Monte, and whose style the work seems to me
to resemble more nearly than it does that of
D&rsquo;Enrico.&nbsp; Whoever the chapel is by, it was evidently
in its present place and much admired in 1586; there could
hardly, therefore, have been any occasion to reconstruct it,
especially when so much other work was crying to be done, and
when it had, in all probability, been once reconstructed
already.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">

</a></p>
<p>On the whole, until external evidence shows D&rsquo;Enrico to
have done the figures, I shall continue to think that at least
one of them, and very possibly all except the two old wooden
ones, are by Tabachetti.&nbsp; The foot of the man binding Christ
to the column has crumbled away, either because the clay was bad,
or from insufficient baking.&nbsp; This is why the figure is
propped up with a piece of wood.&nbsp; The damp has made the rope
slack, so that the pulling action of the figure is in great
measure destroyed, its effect being cancelled by its
ineffectualness; but for this the reader will easily make due
allowance.&nbsp; The same man reappears presently in the balcony
of the Ecce Homo chapel, but he is there evidently done by
another and much less vigorous hand.</p>
<p>The man in the foreground, who is stooping down and binding
his rods, is the same as the one who is kicking Christ in
Tabachetti&rsquo;s Journey to Calvary, and is one of those
adopted by Tabachetti from Gaudenzio Ferrari&rsquo;s Crucifixion
chapel; this figure may perhaps have been an addition by Giovanni
D&rsquo;Enrico, or have been done by an assistant, for it is
hardly up to Tabachetti&rsquo;s mark.&nbsp; The two nearest
scourgers are fine powerful figures, but I should admit that they
remind me rather of D&rsquo;Enrico than of Tabachetti, though
they might also be very well by him, and probably are so.</p>
<p>Fassola says that the graces obtainable by the faithful here
have relation to every kind of need; they are in a high degree
unspecialised, and that this freedom from specialisation is
characteristic of all the chapels of the Passion.</p>
<h3><span class="smcap">Chapel No</span>. 31.&nbsp; <span
class="smcap">The Crowning with Thorns</span>.</h3>
<p>Much that was said about the preceding chapel applies also to
this.&nbsp; It is mentioned in the 1586 edition of Caccia as done
&ldquo;<i>sottilmente in natural ritratto</i>,&rdquo; and as
being one of the few works that would form part of the Palazzo di
Pilato block that were as yet completed.</p>
<p>That this chapel had undergone one reconstruction before 1586,
we may gather from the fact that the left-hand wall is still
covered with a fresco of the Expulsion of Adam and Eve from
Paradise; this has no connection with the Crowning with Thorns,
and doubtless formed the background to the original Adam and
Eve.&nbsp; I have already said that I am indebted to Signor
Arienta for this suggestion.&nbsp; Bordiga calls this subject
Christ being Led to be Crowned, and gives it to Crespi da Cerano,
but I cannot understand how he can see in the work anything but
an Expulsion from Paradise.&nbsp; The chapel having been
reconstructed before 1586 on its present site&mdash;as it
evidently had been&mdash;and being admired, is not likely to have
been reconstructed a second time, and I am again, therefore,
inclined to give the whole work, or at any rate the greater part
of it, to Tabachetti, and to reject the statements of Fassola,
Torrotti, Bordiga, and Cusa, who all ascribe the figures to
D&rsquo;Enrico.&nbsp; The two men standing up behind Christ, one
taunting Him, and the other laughing, are among the finest on the
Sacro Monte, and are much more in Tabachetti&rsquo;s manner than
in D&rsquo;Enrico&rsquo;s.&nbsp; The other figures are, as they
were doubtless intended to be, of minor interest.</p>
<p>Some of the frescoes other than those above referred to, were
added at a later date, and are said by Bordiga, on the authority
of a covenant, dated September 27<i>th</i>, 1608, to have been
done by Antonio Rantio, who undertook to paint them for a sum of
ten ducatoons.&nbsp; They are without interest.</p>
<p>It was here the Flemish dancer was healed.</p>
<p>His name was Bartholomew Jacob, and he came from Graveling in
Flanders.&nbsp; It seems there was a ball going on at the house
of one of this man&rsquo;s ancestors, and that the Last
Sacraments were being carried through the street under the
windows of the ball-room.</p>
<p>The dancing ought by rights to have been stopped, but the host
refused to stop it, and presently the priest who was carrying the
Sacrament found a paper under the chalice, written in a
handwriting of almost superhuman neatness, presumably that of the
Madonna herself and bearing the words, &ldquo;Dancer, thou
wouldst not stay thy dance: I curse thee, therefore, that thou
dance for nine generations.&rdquo;&nbsp; And so he did, he and
all his descendants all their lives, till it came to Bartholomew
Jacob, who was the ninth in descent.&nbsp; He too began life
dancing, and was still dancing when he started on a pilgrimage to
Rome; when, however, he got to the Sacro Monte at Varallo on the
7th of January 1646, he began to feel tired, tremulous, and
languid from so much incessant movement.&nbsp; This strange
feeling attacked him first at the Nativity Chapel, but by the
time he got to the Crowning with Thorns he could stand it no
longer, and fell as one dead, to rise again presently perfectly
whole, and relieved of his distressing complaint.</p>
<p>Personally I find this story interesting as giving high
support to the theory I have been trying to insist upon for some
years past, and according to which in a certain sense a man is
personally identical with all the generations in the direct line
both of his ancestry and his descendants, as well as with
himself.&nbsp; The words &ldquo;Thou shalt dance for nine
generations&rdquo; involve one of the most important points
contended for in my earlier book, &ldquo;Life and
Habit.&rdquo;&nbsp; Fassola and Torrotti both say that more
pilgrims left alms at this chapel than at any other.&nbsp; In
fact they both seem to consider that this chapel did very
well.&nbsp; &ldquo;Qu&igrave;,&rdquo; says Torrotti, &ldquo;si
colgano elemosine assai,&rdquo; and, as I have said already, it
is here that a few autumn leaves of waxen images still
linger.</p>
<p>A few weeks ago I saw the original document in which the story
above given was attested.&nbsp; It was dated 1671, and signed,
stamped, and sealed as a document of the highest
importance.&nbsp; I noticed that in this manuscript, it was a
voice that was heard, and not as in Fassola a letter that was
found.</p>
<h3><span class="smcap">Chapel No.</span> 32.&nbsp; <span
class="smcap">Christ at the Steps of the Pretorium</span>.</h3>
<p>This is not mentioned in the 1586 edition of Caccia, perhaps
as being a poor and unimportant work.&nbsp; Fassola says that
some of the frescoes, as well as of the statues, which, he says,
are of wood, were by Gaudenzio.&nbsp; The other statues are given
both by Fassola and Torrotti to D&rsquo;Enrico, and the paintings
to Gianoli, a wealthy Valsesian amateur who lived at
Campertogno.&nbsp; Bordiga gives the statues to Ferro, already
mentioned as a pupil of D&rsquo;Enrico, but whoever did them,
they are about as bad as they can be&mdash;too bad, I should say,
for Giacomo Ferro, and I am not sure that they are not of wood
even now.&nbsp; No traces of Gaudenzio&rsquo;s frescoes
remain.&nbsp; The chapel seems to have been reconstructed in
connection with the <i>replica</i> of the Scala Santa up which
Christ is going to be conducted.&nbsp; We have seen that the
design for these stairs was procured from Rome in 1608 by
Francesco Testa, who was then Fabbriciere.</p>
<h3><span class="smcap">Chapel No.</span> 33.&nbsp; <span
class="smcap">Ecce Homo</span>.</h3>
<p>This is one of the finest chapels, the concert between the
figures being better than in most of D&rsquo;Enrico&rsquo;s other
work, notwithstanding the fact that more than one, and probably
several, are old figures taken from chapels that were displaced
when the Palazzo di Pilato block was made.&nbsp; The figures are
thirty-seven in number, and are disposed in a spacious hall not
wholly unlike the vestibule of the Reform Club, Christ and His
immediate persecutors appearing in a balustraded balcony above a
spacious portico that supports it.&nbsp; This must have been one
of D&rsquo;Enrico&rsquo;s first works on the Sacro Monte, the
frescoes having been paid for on Dec. 7, 1612, as shown by
Morazzone&rsquo;s receipt which is still in existence, and which
is for the sum of 2400 <i>imperiali</i>.&nbsp; Of these frescoes
it is impossible to speak highly; they look clever at first and
from a distance, but do not bear closer attention.&nbsp;
Morazzone took pains with the Journey to Calvary chapel, which
was his first work on the Sacro Monte, but never did anything so
good again.</p>

</a></p>
<p>Of the terra-cotta figures, the one to the extreme left is
certainly by Gaudenzio Ferrari, being another portrait, in nearly
the same attitude, of the extreme figure to the left in the
Crucifixion chapel.&nbsp; For reasons into which I will enter
more fully when I come to this last-named work, I do not doubt
that Stefano Scotto, Gaudenzio&rsquo;s master, is the person
represented.&nbsp; I had to go inside the chapel to hold a sheet
behind the figure in order to detach it from the background, so
had myself taken along with it to show how it compares with a
living figure.&nbsp; It is generally said at Varallo to be a
portrait of Giovanno D&rsquo;Enrico&rsquo;s brother Tanzio, but
this is obviously impossible, for not only does the same person
reappear in the Crucifixion chapel, but he is also found in
Gaudenzio&rsquo;s early fresco of the Disputa in the Sta.
Margherita chapel already referred to, and elsewhere, as I will
presently show.&nbsp; I should be sorry to say that any other
figure in the Ecce Homo chapel except this is certainly by
Gaudenzio, but am inclined to think that two or three others are
also by him, the rest being probably all of them by
D&rsquo;Enrico or some assistant.&nbsp; Some&mdash;more
especially two children, on the head of one of whom a man has
laid his hand&mdash;are of extreme beauty.&nbsp; The child that
is looking up is among the most beautiful in the whole range of
sculpture; the other is not so good, but has suffered in
re-painting, the eyelid being made too red; if this were
remedied, as it easily might be, the figure would gain
greatly.&nbsp; Cav. Prof. Antonini has very successfully
substituted plaster hair for the horsehair, which had in great
measure fallen off.&nbsp; The motive of this incidental group is
repeated, but with less success, in Giovanni
D&rsquo;Enrico&rsquo;s Nailing to the Cross.</p>
<p>There is another child to the extreme right of the composition
so commonly and poorly done that it is hard to believe it can be
by the same hand, but it is not likely that Giacomo Ferro had as
yet become D&rsquo;Enrico&rsquo;s assistant.&nbsp; The man who is
pointing out Christ to this last-named child is far more
seriously treated, and might even be an importation from an
earlier work.&nbsp; Among other very fine figures is a man who is
looking up and holding a staff in his hand; he stands against the
wall to the spectator&rsquo;s right among the figures nearest to
the grating.&nbsp; There is also an admirable figure of a man on
one knee tying his cross garter and at the same time looking
up.&nbsp; This figure is in the background rather hidden away,
and is not very well seen from the grating.&nbsp; I should add
that the floor of the chapel slopes a little up from the
spectator like the stage in a theatre.</p>
<p>The dog in the middle foreground is hollow, as are all the
figures, or at any rate many of them, and shows a great hole on
the side away from the spectator; it is not fixed to the ground,
but stands on its own legs; it was as much as I could do to lift
it.&nbsp; I am told the figures were baked down below in the
town, and though they are most of them in several pieces it must
have been no light work carrying them up the mountain.&nbsp; I
have been shown the remains of a furnace near the present church
on the Sacro Monte, but believe it was only used for the figures
made by Luigi Marchesi in 1826.&nbsp; I should, however, have
thought that the figures would have been baked upon the Sacro
Monte itself and not in the town.</p>
<p>Of this chapel Fassola says:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;All the pilgrims of every description come
here, because it is at the top of the <i>Scala Santa</i> up which
they go upon their knees, and there is plenty of room for
pilgrims, as the chapel extends the whole width of the
staircase.&nbsp; Those who are oppressed with travail, or fevers,
or lawsuits, or unjust persecutions of any description, are
comforted on being commended to this Christ.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;Vi sono qu&igrave;,&rdquo; says Torrotti, &ldquo;pascoli
deliziosi per i curiosi e pi&ugrave; dotti.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I daresay that on the great festivals of the Church, some
pilgrims may still go up the Scala Santa kneeling, but they do
not commonly do so.&nbsp; Often as I have been at the Sacro
Monte, I never yet saw a pilgrim mount the staircase except on
his feet in the usual way.&nbsp; It must be a very painful

<h3><span class="smcap">Chapel No</span>. 34.&nbsp; <span
class="smcap">Pilate Washing his Hands</span>.</h3>
<p>Fassola, Torrotti, and Bordiga all call this one of the best
chapels, but neither Jones nor I could see that it was nearly so
successful as the preceding.&nbsp; The seventeen modelled figures
are by Giovanni D&rsquo;Enrico, and the frescoes by his brother
Antonio or Tanzio.&nbsp; One or two of the
figures&mdash;especially a man putting his finger to his mouth
derisively, are excellent, but the Pilate is a complete failure;
and it is hard to think it can have been done, as it probably
nevertheless was, by the sculptor of the Caiaphas and Herod
figures.&nbsp; Bordiga says that a contract was made with Caccia
(not the historian), called Moncalvo, for the frescoes.&nbsp;
This was the painter who did the backgrounds for the Crea
chapels, but the contract was never carried out, probably because
Antonio D&rsquo;Enrico returned from Rome.&nbsp; It was dated
November 1616, so that the terra-cotta figures probably belong to
this year or to those that immediately preceded it.</p>
<h3><span class="smcap">Chapel No</span>. 35.&nbsp; <span
class="smcap">Christ Condemned to Death</span>.</h3>
<p>This is better than the preceding chapel, and contains some
good individual figures.&nbsp; The statues are twenty-seven in
number, and were modelled by D&rsquo;Enrico prior to the year
1614, in which year Morazzone was paid twelve hundred imperiali
for having painted the frescoes, so that it was one of his
earlier works, but the Pilate is again a failure.&nbsp; People
who have been badly treated, and who have suffered from some
injustice, are more especially recommended by Fassola &ldquo;to
try this Christ, who moves the pity of all who look upon
Him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He continues that it was the intention to add some other
chapels at the end of the portico of the Palazzo di Pilato, but
this intention was not carried out.&nbsp; Bordiga calls attention
to the view on the right, looking over Varallo and the
Mastallone, as soon as the portico is passed.</p>

<p>This, having regard to the terra-cotta figures alone, is by
far the finest work on the Sacro Monte, and it is hardly too much
to say that no one who has not seen it knows what sculpture can
do.&nbsp; I have sufficiently shown that all the authorities, not
one of whom has ever so much as seen a page of Caccia, are wrong
by at least twenty years, when they say that Tabachetti completed
the work in 1606.&nbsp; Bordiga refers, and this time I have no
doubt accurately, to a deed drawn up in 1602, in accordance with
which the fresco background was begun by Antonio Gandino, a
painter of Brescia; this alone should have made Bordiga suspect
that the terra-cotta work had been already completed, but he does
not appear to have noted the fact, and goes on to say that the
agreement with Gandino was cancelled by Bishop Bescap&egrave; in
1604, and that his work was destroyed, the chapel being handed
over to Morazzone, who painted it in 1605, and was paid 1400
lire, besides twenty gold scudi.&nbsp; Morazzone has followed
Gaudenzio boldly, repeating several of his fresco figures, as
Tabachetti, with admirable good taste, had repeated several of
his terra-cotta ones, while completely varying the action.&nbsp;
The right-hand frescoes, and part of those on the wall opposite
the spectator, have been recently cut away in squares, and
relined, as the wall was perishing from damp.</p>

<p>The statues consist of about forty figures of men, women, and
children, and nine horses, all rather larger than life.&nbsp;
They too have suffered from the effect of damp upon the paint;
nevertheless, a more permanent and satisfactory kind of pigment
has been used here than in most of the chapels; the work does not
seem to have been much, if at all repainted, since Tabachetti
left it.&nbsp; One figure of a child in the foreground has
disappeared, the marks of its feet and two little bits of rusty
iron alone show where it was; the woman who was holding it also
remains without an arm.&nbsp; I am tempted to think that some
disturbing cause has affected a girl who is holding a puppy, a
little to the right of this last figure, and doubt whether
something that accompanied her may not have perished; at any
rate, it does not group with the other figures as well as these
do with one another; this, however, is a very small
blemish.&nbsp; The work is one that will grow upon the reader the
more he studies it, and should rank as the most successfully
ambitious of medieval compositions in sculpture, no less surely
than Gaudenzio&rsquo;s Crucifixion chapel, having regard to
grandeur of scheme as well as execution, should rank as the most
daring among Italian works of art in general.&nbsp; I am aware
that this must strike many of my readers as in all probability a
very exaggerated estimate, but can only repeat that I have
studied these works for the last twenty years with every desire
not to let a false impression run away with me, and that each
successive visit to Varallo, while tending somewhat to lower my
estimate of Giovanni D&rsquo;Enrico&mdash;unless when he is at
his very best&mdash;has increased my admiration for both
Gaudenzio Ferrari and Tabachetti, as also, I would add, for the
sculptor of the Massacre of the Innocents chapel.</p>

<p>It cannot, indeed, be pretended that Tabachetti&rsquo;s style
is as pure as that of his great predecessor, but what it has lost
in purity it has gained in freedom and vigour.&nbsp; It is not
possible that an artist working in the years 1580&ndash;1585
should present to us traces of the archaism which even the most
advanced sculptors of half a century earlier had not wholly
lost.&nbsp; The stronger a man is the more certainly will he be
modified by his own times as well as modify them, and in an age
of <i>barocco</i> we must not look for Donatellos.&nbsp; Still,
the more Tabachetti&rsquo;s work is examined the more will it be
observed that he took no harm from the <i>barocco</i>, but kept
its freedom while avoiding its coarseness and exaggeration.&nbsp;
For reasons explained in an earlier chapter his figures are not
generally portraits, but he is eminently realistic, and if he did
the Vecchietto, of which I have given a photograph at the
beginning of this book, he must be credited with one of the most
living figures that have ever been made&mdash;a figure which
rides on the very highest crest of the wave, and neither admits
possibility of further advance towards realism without defeating
its own purpose, nor shows even the slightest sign of
decadence.&nbsp; Of the figure of the Countess of Serravalle, to
which I have already referred, Torrotti said it was so much
admired in his day that certain Venetian cavaliers offered to buy
it for its weight in gold, but that the mere consideration of
such an offer would be high treason (<i>lesa Maest&agrave;</i>)
to the Sacro Monte.&nbsp; Fassola and Torrotti, as well as
Bordiga and Cusa, are evidently alive to the fact that as far as
sculpture goes we have here the highest triumph attained on the
Sacro Monte of Varallo.</p>
<p>I had better perhaps give the words in which Caccia describes
the work.&nbsp; In the 1586 edition, we read, in the preliminary
prose part, as follows:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Come N. S. &egrave; condotto alla morte con
la croce alle spalle, qual si vede tutto di rilievo.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The poetical account runs thus:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Si trova poi in una Chiesa nera<br />
Con spettacolo fiero accompagnato<br />
Da soldati, e da gente molto fiera,<br />
Con la Croce alle spalle incaminato<br />
Christo Giesu in mezzo &agrave; l&rsquo;empia schiera,<br />
Seguendolo Giovanni addolorato,<br />
Che di Giesu sostien la sconsolata<br />
Madre, da Maddalena accompagnata.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the 1591 edition, the prose description of the work
runs;&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Come N. S. &egrave; condotto alla morte con
la Croce sopra delle spalle, quali si vedeno tutto di rilieuo
bellissi.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I have no copy of the poetical part of this edition before me,
but believe it to be identical with the version already
given.&nbsp; The impression left upon me is that the work in 1586
was only just finished enough to allow it to be called finished,
and that its full excellence was not yet displayed to the public,
though it was about to be so very shortly.</p>
<p>Signor Arienta tells me that Tabachetti has adhered rather
closely to a design for the same subject by Albert Durer, but I
have failed to find the design to which he is referring.</p>
<p>Bordiga again calls attention to the extreme beauty of the
view of Varallo that is to be had on leaving this chapel.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Chapel No</span>. 37.&nbsp; <span
class="smcap">The Nailing of Christ to the Cross</span>.</h3>
<p>This and the two following chapels are on the top of the small
rise of some fifteen or twenty feet in which Bernardino Caimi is
said to have seen a resemblance to Mount Calvary; they are
approached by a staircase which leads directly to Giovanni
D&rsquo;Enrico&rsquo;s largest work.</p>
<p>Bordiga says that the chapel was begun in 1589 at the expense
of Marchese Giacomo d&rsquo;Adda; he probably, however, refers
only to the building itself.&nbsp; It is not mentioned as even
contemplated in the 1586 edition of Caccia, nor yet, unless my
memory fails me, in that of 1590.&nbsp; It is not known when the
terra-cotta work was begun, but it was not yet quite finished in
1644, when, as I have said, D&rsquo;Enrico died.</p>
<p>The frescoes are by Melchiorre Gilardini, and have been
sufficiently praised by other writers; they are fairly well
preserved, and show, as in the preceding chapel and in
Gaudenzio&rsquo;s Crucifixion, how much more is to be said for
the union of painting and sculpture when both are in the hands of
capable men, than we are apt to think.&nbsp; If the reader will
divest the sculpture of its colour and background, how cold and
uninteresting will it not seem in comparison even with its
present somewhat impaired splendour.&nbsp; Looking at the really
marvellous results that have been achieved, we cannot refrain
from a passing regret at the spite that threw Tabachetti half a
century off Gaudenzio, instead of letting them come together, but
we must take these things as we find them.</p>
<p>On first seeing Giovanni D&rsquo;Enrico&rsquo;s Nailing to the
Cross we are tempted to think it even finer than the Journey to
Calvary.&nbsp; The work is larger, comprising some twenty or so
more terra-cotta figures&mdash;making about sixty in
all&mdash;and ten horses, all rather larger than life, but the
first impression soon wears off and the arrangement is then felt
to be artificial as compared with Tabachetti&rsquo;s.&nbsp;
Tabachetti made a great point when, instead of keeping his floor
flat or sloping it evenly up to any one side, he threw his stage
up towards one corner, which is much higher than any other.&nbsp;
The unevenness, and irregular unevenness, of the ground is of the
greatest assistance to him, by giving him variety of plane, and
hence a way of escaping monotony without further effort on his
part.&nbsp; If D&rsquo;Enrico had taken his ground down from the
corner up to which Tabachetti had led it, he would have secured
both continuity with Tabachetti&rsquo;s scene, and an irregularly
uneven surface, without repeating his predecessor&rsquo;s
arrangement.&nbsp; True, the procession was supposed to be at the
top of Mount Calvary, but that is a detail.&nbsp; As it is,
D&rsquo;Enrico has copied Tabachetti in making his ground slope,
but, unless my memory fails me, has made it slope evenly along
the whole width of the chapel, from the foreground to the wall at
the back&mdash;with the exception of a small mound in the middle
background.&nbsp; The horses are arranged all round the walls,
and the soldiers are all alongside of the horses, and every
figure is so placed as to show itself to the greatest
advantage.&nbsp; This perhaps is exaggeration, but there is
enough truth in it to help the reader who is unfamiliar with this
class of work to apprehend Tabachetti&rsquo;s superiority more
readily than he might otherwise do in the short time that
tourists commonly have at their disposal.&nbsp; The general
impression left upon myself and Jones was that it contains much
more of Giacomo Ferro than of D&rsquo;Enrico; but in spite of
this it is impossible to deny that the work is important and on
the whole impressive.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Chapel No</span>. 38.&nbsp; <span
class="smcap">The Crucifixion</span>.</h3>
<p>Neither Fassola nor Torrotti date this work, but I have
already shown reasons for believing that it should be given to
the years 1524&ndash;1528.&nbsp; Fassola says that the figure of
Christ on the Cross is not the original one, which was stolen,
and somehow or other found its way to the Church of S. Andrea at
Vercelli, where, according to Colombo (p. 237), a crucifix,
traditionally said to be this one, was preserved until the close
of the last century.&nbsp; Bordiga says that there is no reason
to believe this story.&nbsp; The present crucifix is of wood, and
is probably an old one long venerated, and embodied in his work
by Gaudenzio himself, partly out of respect to public feeling,
and partly, perhaps, as an unexceptionable excuse for avoiding a
great difficulty.&nbsp; The thieves also, according to Bordiga
and Cusa, are of wood, not terra-cotta, being done from models in
clay by Gaudenzio as though the wood were marble.&nbsp; We may be
sure there was an excellent reason for this solitary instance of
a return to wood, but it is not immediately apparent to a
layman.</p>

</a></p>
<p>We have met with the extreme figure to the spectator&rsquo;s
left in the Ecce Homo chapel.&nbsp; He is also, as I have said,
found in the Disputa fresco, done some twenty years or so before
the work we are now considering, and we might be tempted to think
that the person who was so powerfully impressed on
Gaudenzio&rsquo;s mind during so many years was some Varallo
notable, or failing this that he was some model whom he was in
the habit of employing.&nbsp; This, however, is not so; for in
the first place the supposed model was an old man in, say, 1507,
and he is not a day older in 1527, so that in 1527 Gaudenzio was
working from a strong residuary impression of a figure with which
he had been familiar many years previously and not from life; and
in the second, we find the head repeated in the works of Milanese
artists who in all probability never came near Varallo.&nbsp; We
certainly find it in a drawing, of which I give a reduced
reproduction, and which the British Museum authorities ascribe,
no doubt correctly, to Bernardino de&rsquo; Conti.&nbsp; I also
recognise it unquestionably in a drawing in the Windsor
collection ascribed to Leonardo da Vinci&mdash;a drawing,
however, which it is not easy to think is actually by him.&nbsp;
I have no doubt that a reminiscence of the same head is intended
in a drawing ascribed to Leonardo da Vinci in the Biblioteca
Ambrosiana, only that the artist, whoever he may be, has added
hair (which is obviously not drawn from nature), and has not
produced so good a likeness as Gaudenzio and Bernardino de&rsquo;
Conti have done, but about this last I am less certain.&nbsp; At
any rate there can be no doubt that the figure represents a
Milanese character who in the time of Gaudenzio&rsquo;s youth was
familiar to Milanese artists, and who made a deep impression upon
more than one of them.&nbsp; This will be even more apparent to
those who are familiar with the terra-cotta figures at Varallo,
for these can be seen from several points of view, and a fuller
knowledge of the head is thus obtained than a flat impression
from a single point can give.</p>
<p>It is not likely that the figure is that of a mere model, for
it has no, or very little connection with the action of the
piece, and is evidently placed where it is&mdash;the extreme
figure to the left, which is always a place of honour&mdash;for
the sake of introducing the portrait into the composition.&nbsp;
Gaudenzio would not have been so impressed, say, with old
Christie <a name="citation206"></a><a href="#footnote206"
class="citation">[206]</a> as to give his portrait from memory
twenty years after he had seen him last, to put this portrait in
the place of honour, and to make the work much more emphatic as a
portrait than as the figure of an actor in his drama, inasmuch as
he has turned the head towards the spectator and away from the
central incident.&nbsp; It is more probable, then, that we must
look for some well-known Milanese art-world character as the
original for which the figure was intended.</p>

</a></p>
<p>We know that Gaudenzio Ferrari studied under Stefano Scotto,
and have every reason to think that Bernardino de&rsquo;
Conti&mdash;who, I see, studied in the school of Foppa, one of
Scotto&rsquo;s predecessors, if not under Scotto himself, must
have known him perfectly well.&nbsp; Leonardo da Vinci kept the
rival school at Milan, and the two schools were to one another
much what those kept by the late Mr. F. S. Cary and Mr. Lee were
some thirty years ago in London.&nbsp; Leonardo, therefore, also
doubtless knew Scotto by sight if not personally.&nbsp; I incline
to think, then, that we have here the original we are looking
for, and that Gaudenzio when working at what he probably regarded
as the most important work of his life determined to introduce
his master, just as I, if I were writing a novel, might be
tempted to introduce a reminiscence of my own old schoolmaster,
and to make the portrait as faithful as I could.</p>

 src="images/p207s.jpg" />
</a></p>
<p>I am confirmed in this opinion by noting, as I have done for
many years past, that the figure next to that of Scotto is not
unlike the portraits of Leonardo da Vinci, of which I give the
one (whether by himself or no I do not know) that I believe to be
the best.&nbsp; I had been reminded of Leonardo da Vinci by this
figure long before I knew of Scotto&rsquo;s existence, and had
often wondered why he was not made the outside and most prominent
figure; now, then, that I see reason to think the outside figure
intended for Gaudenzio&rsquo;s own master, I understand why the
preference has been given him, and have little doubt that next to
his own master Gaudenzio has placed the other great contemporary
art-teacher at Milan whose pupil he never actually was, but whose
influence he must have felt profoundly.&nbsp; I also derive an
impression that Gaudenzio liked and respected Scotto though he
may have laughed at him, but that he did not like Leonardo, who
by the way had been dead about ten years when this figure was
placed where it now is.</p>
<p>I see, therefore, the two figures as those of Scotto and of
Leonardo da Vinci, and think it likely that in the one portrait
we have by far the most characteristic likeness of Leonardo that
has come down to us.&nbsp; In his own drawings of himself he made
himself out such as he wanted others to think him; here, if I
mistake not, he has been rendered as others saw him.&nbsp; The
portrait of Scotto is beyond question an admirable likeness; it
is not likely that the Leonardo is less successful, and we find
in the searching, eager, harassed, and harassing unquiet of the
figure here given a more acceptable rendering of Leonardo&rsquo;s
character and appearance than any among the likenesses of himself
which are more or less plausibly ascribed to him.&nbsp; The
question is one of so much interest that I must defer its fuller
treatment for another work, in which I hope to deal with the
portraits of Giovanni and Gentile Bellini, and with
Holbein&rsquo;s &ldquo;Danse des Paysans.&rdquo;&nbsp; I have,
however, given above the greater part of the information of which
I am as yet possessed upon the subject.&nbsp; In conclusion, I
may say that I mentioned the matter to Signor Boccioloni the
Sindaco of Varallo, and to other friends with whom I have
discussed the question on the spot, and found that people
generally seemed to consider the case as rather a strong one.</p>
<p>As regards the portraits supposed to be found on the frescoes,
they are all so doubtful that I will refrain from discussing
them, but will refer my readers to Colombo.&nbsp; The only
exception is a portrait of one of the Scarrognini family which is
seen on the right-hand wall above the door, the fact of the
portraiture being attested by a barbarous scrawl upon the fresco
itself.</p>
<p>Caccia says of the work with more enthusiasm than even I can
command, but in a style of poetry which I find it fairly easy to
render, that we may see among the spectators</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo; . . . &agrave; maraviglia,<br />
Vi son pi&ugrave; donne con la sua famiglia;&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>which means in English&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;And here you may behold with wondering
eyes,<br />
Several ladies with their families.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He continues that</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Gli Angeli star nel ciel tutti dolenti<br
/>
Si veggon per piet&agrave; del suo Signore,<br />
E turbati mostrarsi gli elementi,<br />
Privi del sole, e d&rsquo; ogni suo splendore,<br />

<p>Returning to the work as a whole, if the modelled figures fail
anywhere it is in respect of action&mdash;more especially as
regards the figures to the spectator&rsquo;s right, which want
the concert and connection without which a scene ceases to be
dramatic, and becomes a mere assemblage of figures placed in
juxtaposition.&nbsp; It would be going too far to say that
complaint on this score can be justly insisted on in respect even
of these figures; nevertheless it will be felt that Gaudenzio
Ferrari the painter could harmonise his figures and give them a
unity of action which was denied to him as a sculptor.&nbsp; It
must not be forgotten that his modelled work derives an
adventitious merit from the splendour of the frescoes with which
it is surrounded, and from our admiration of the astounding range
of power manifested by their author.</p>
<p>As a painter, it must be admitted that Gaudenzio Ferrari was
second to very few that had gone before him, but as a sculptor,
he did not do enough to attain perfect mastery over his
art.&nbsp; If he had done as much in sculpture as in painting he
would doubtless have been as great a master of the one as the
other; as it was, in sculpture he never got beyond the stage of
being an exceedingly able and interesting scholar;&mdash;this,
however, is just the kind of person whose work in spite of
imperfection is most permanently delightful.&nbsp; Among the
defects which he might have overcome is one that is visible in
his earlier painting as well as in his sculpture, and which in
painting he got rid of, though evidently not without
difficulty&mdash;I mean, a tendency to get some of his figures
unduly below life size.&nbsp; I have often seen in his paintings
that he has got his figures rather below life size, when
apparently intending that they should be full-sized, and worse
than this, that some are smaller in proportion than others.&nbsp;
Nevertheless, when we bear in mind that the Crucifixion chapel
was the first work of its kind, that it consists of four large
walls and a ceiling covered with magnificent frescoes, comprising
about 150 figures; that it contains twenty-six life-sized
statues, two of them on horseback, and much detail by way of
accessory, all done with the utmost care, and all coloured up to
nature,&mdash;when we bear this in mind and realise what it all
means, it is not easy to refrain from saying, as I have earlier
done, that the Crucifixion chapel is the most daringly ambitious
work of art that any one man was ever yet known to undertake; and
if we could see it as Gaudenzio left it, we should probably own
that in the skill with which the conception was carried out, no
less than in its initial daring, it should rank as perhaps the
most remarkable work of art that even Italy has produced.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fassola</span> and Torrotti both say that
the terra-cotta figures here are by a pupil of Giovanni
D&rsquo;Enrico.&nbsp; Bordiga says that the three figures forming
the group upon the cross were done contemporaneously with the
Nailing of Christ to the Cross, which we have already considered,
and are in the style of D&rsquo;Enrico.&nbsp; If so, they are not
in his best style, while the others are among the worst on the
Sacro Monte, with the exception of one, which I never even
observed until last summer, so completely is it overpowered by
the worse than mediocrity with which it is surrounded.&nbsp; This
figure is perhaps, take it all round, the finest on the Sacro
Monte, and is generally known as &ldquo;Il Vecchietto&rdquo; or
&ldquo;the little old man.&rdquo;&nbsp; It is given as the
frontispiece of this book.</p>
<p>I was led to observe it by a casual remark made by my old and
valued friend Signor Dionigi Negri of Varallo, to whom I am
indebted for invaluable assistance in writing this book, and
indeed at whose instigation it was undertaken.&nbsp; He told me
there was a portrait of the man who gave this part of the ground
to the founders of the Sanctuary; he was believed to be a small
peasant proprietor&mdash;one of the &ldquo;alcuni particolari
poueri&rdquo; mentioned by Fassola as owning the site&mdash;who,
having been asked to sell the land, gave it instead.&nbsp; This
was the story, but I knew that the land was given not later than
1490&ndash;1493, whereas the chapel in question is not earlier
than 1630, when no portrait of the peasant benefactor was
possible.&nbsp; I therefore went to the chapel, and finding the
figure, saw what must be obvious to any one who looks at it with
attention, I mean, firstly, how fine it was, and secondly, that
it had not been designed for its present place.</p>
<p>This last is clear from the hand, which from outside at first
appears to be holding a pair of pincers and a hammer, as though
to assist at the Deposition, but which proves to have been
originally designed to hold a stick&mdash;or something round, the
hammer and pincers being at present tied on with a piece of
string, to a hand that is not holding them.&nbsp; I asked the
opinion of Cav. Prof Antonini of Varallo and his son, both of
them admirable sculptors, and found them as decided as myself in
their admiration of the figure.&nbsp; Both of them, at different
times, were good enough to go inside the chapel with me, and both
agreed with me that the figure was no part of the design of the
group in which it now is.&nbsp; Cav. Prof. Antonini thought the
whole right arm had been restored, but it was getting dusk when
he suggested this, and I could not see clearly enough to form an
opinion; I have the greatest diffidence in differing from so
excellent an authority, but so far as I could see, I did not
think there had been any restoration.&nbsp; I thought nothing had
been done except to put a piece of string through the hole in the
hand where a stick or roll had been, and to hang the hammer and
pincers with it.&nbsp; Leaving Varallo early on the following
morning, I was unable to see the figure again by day-light, and
must allow the question of restoration or non-restoration to
remain unsettled.</p>
<p>There is a large well-defined patch of mended ground covering
the space occupied by the figure itself.&nbsp; There is no other
such patch under any other figure, and the most reasonable
inference is that some alteration has been made here.&nbsp; The
expression, moreover, of the face is not suitable for a
Deposition.</p>
<p>There is a holy tranquil smile of joy, thankfulness, and
satisfaction, which perfectly well befits one who is looking up
into the heavens, as he might at an Assumption of the Virgin, or
an Ascension, but is not the expression which so consummate an
artist as the man who made this figure, would give to a bystander
at a Deposition from the Cross.&nbsp; Grief and horror, would be
still too recent to admit of the sweet serene air of ineffable
contentment which is here given.</p>
<p>Lastly, the style of the work is so different from that of all
the other figures in the chapel, that no solidarity can be seen
between it and them.&nbsp; It would be too much to say that the
others are as bad as this is good, but the difference between
Rembrandt&rsquo;s old woman in our National Gallery and an
average Royal Academy portrait of fifty years ago, is not more
striking than that between the Vecchietto and his immediate
neighbours.</p>
<p>I can find no mention of the figure in Fassola, or
Torrotti.&nbsp; Bordiga says, &ldquo;On the left there is a man
in peasant&rsquo;s costume, holding his hat in reverence of
Jesus, and said to be a benefactor of the chapel.&rdquo;&nbsp; He
does not say anything about the excellence of the workmanship,
nor, indeed, have I heard any one, except the two sculptors, Cav.
Prof. Antonini and his son, speak of the work in terms which
showed a perception of its merit.&nbsp; If the world knows little
of its greatest men it seems to know not much more about its
greatest works of art, nor, if it continues to look for guidance
in this matter to professional critics and society art-dabblers,
is it likely to improve its knowledge.&nbsp; Cusa says of
it:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;&Egrave; fra essi un vecchietto naturale
assai pel rozzo costume che veste, e per la semplicit&agrave; del
atto; egli guarda Ges&ugrave; in atto di levarsi il cappello,
mentre con l&rsquo;altra mano tiene le tenaglie ed il
martello.&nbsp; Lo si dice ritratto di un Rimellese, benefattore
della cappella.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I asked the two sculptors Antonini if they could help me in
settling the question to whom the work should be assigned, and
they agreed with me that it could not be given to
Gaudenzio.&nbsp; It is too masterly, easy, and too like the work
of Velasquez in painting, to be by one who is not known to have
done more in sculpture than some two score or so of figures on
the Sacro Monte now remaining, and a few others that have been
lost.&nbsp; The Vecchietto is the work of one to whom modelling
in clay was like breathing, walking, or eating and drinking, and
Gaudenzio never reached such freedom and proficiency as this.</p>
<p>With few exceptions even the best art-work falls into one of
two classes, and offers signs either of immaturity or
decline.&nbsp; Take Donatello, and Luca della Robbia, or, in
painting, Giovanni Bellini, John Van Eyck, Holbein, Giotto, and
even Gaudenzio Ferarri in his earlier work; take again, in music,
Purcell and Corelli; no words of affectionate admiration are good
enough for any one of these great men, but they none of them say
the last word that is to be said in their respective arts.&nbsp;
Michael Angelo said the last word; but then he said just a word
or two over.&nbsp; So with Titian and Leonardo Da Vinci, and in
music with Haydn, Mozart, and Beethoven.&nbsp; We admire them,
and know that each in many respects surpassed everything that has
been done either before or since, but in each case (and more
especially with the three last named) we feel the presence of an
autumnal tint over all the luxuriance of development, which,
while hardly detracting from the pleasure we receive, still tells
of an art that has taken not an upward but a downward path.&nbsp;
I know that I am apt to take fancies to works of art and artists;
I hold, for example, that my friend Mr. H. F. Jones&rsquo;s
songs, of which I have given the titles at the end of this
volume, are finer than an equal number of any written by any
other living composer&mdash;and I believe that people will one
day agree with me, though they will doubtless take their time in
doing so&mdash;but with all this tendency towards extravagance I
endeavour to preserve a method in my madness, and with most works
find that they fall readily into the growing or the
decaying.&nbsp; It is only with very few, as with Homer and
Shakespeare at their best, the Venus of Milo, the Ilyssus, the
finest work of Rembrandt, Giorgione, and Velasquez, and in music
with Handel, that I can see no step left unclimbed, yet none
taken on the downward path.&nbsp; Assuredly the Vecchietto must
be classed with the very few works which, being of the kind of
fruit that they are, are dead ripe, without one trace either of
immaturity or decay.</p>
<p>Difficult, however, as the problem who made this statue is, it
is simplified by the reflection that it can only be given either
to Gaudenzio or Tabachetti.&nbsp; I suggested
D&rsquo;Enrico&rsquo;s name to Cav. Prof. Antonini to see how he
received it, but&mdash;thinking doubtless more of Giacomo Ferro
than of D&rsquo;Enrico&mdash;he said &ldquo;E-whew,&rdquo; and
tossed his thumb over his shoulder, as only an Italian can, as
much as to say that D&rsquo;Enrico set about his figures with too
light a heart to get a Vecchietto out of them; Gaudenzio, then,
being impossible and D&rsquo;Enrico ordered out of court, it only
remains to give the work to Tabachetti, with whose sleeping St.
Joseph and with not a little else of whose work it presents much
analogy; for the notion that a stranger of name unknown came to
Varallo, did this single figure, and then went away without doing
any more either there or anywhere else in the least like it, is
as incredible as that it is the work of D&rsquo;Enrico.</p>
<p>As for the question of the source from which the figure came
we should remember that the <i>Chiesa Vecchia dell&rsquo;
Assunta</i> was pulled down at the end of the last century; and
this, considering the excellent preservation in which the
Vecchietto is still found, and the comparatively recent
appearance of the disturbance of the ground under his feet, seems
the most likely place for him to have come from.&nbsp; There were
two opportunities in this church, one of which certainly was,
while the other very well might have been, made the occasion for
a group of figures with upturned heads.&nbsp; The first of these,
of course, is the Assumption of the Madonna, of which Caccia says
there was a representation of her &ldquo;<i>Come ascese in
Cielo</i>, <i>con le statue delli dodeci Apostoli intorno di
rilievo</i>,&rdquo; and there may very well have been a
benefactor or so in addition.&nbsp; The second was the impress of
our Saviour&rsquo;s last footprint on the Mount of Olives before
He ascended into heaven.&nbsp; This is mentioned by Fassola as a
feature of special importance, and as having had an indulgence
conceded to it by the Pope in 1488 while it was on its road from
Jerusalem.&nbsp; This relic was held in great veneration, and it
is easy to imagine that its effect may have been enhanced by
surrounding it with figures looking upwards into the heavens
towards the clouds that had already received the body of the
Redeemer.&nbsp; All this, however, is mere conjecture, for there
is not a tittle of evidence in support of it, and we are left
practically with nothing more than we can still see within the
limits of the figure itself to give a clue either to its maker,
or the source from which it came, but we may incline to think
that it is the portrait of a benefactor, for no one but a
benefactor would have been treated with so much realism.&nbsp;
The man is not a mere peasant; his clothes are homely, but they
are good, and there is that about him which harmonises well
enough with his having been in a position of comfort.&nbsp;
Common peasants may be seen in the Shepherd&rsquo;s chapel, and
the Vecchietto is clearly of higher social status than
these.&nbsp; He looks like a Valsesian yeoman or peasant
proprietor, of some substance; and he was doubtless a benefactor,
not of this, but some other chapel.</p>
<p>I have said there are analogies between this figure and others
by Tabachetti which after all make it not very difficult to
decide the question to whom it should be given.&nbsp; We do not,
indeed, find another Vecchietto, but we shall find more than one
figure that exhibits equal truth to nature, and equal freedom
from exaggeration.&nbsp; It is not possible, for example, to have
greater truth to nature than we find in the figures of Adam and
Eve in the first chapel.&nbsp; There is not one trace either of
too much or too little, of exaggeration or of shortcoming; the
nude figure of a man and of a woman were wanted, and the nude
figure of a man and of a woman are given, with neither more or
less modelling than what would be most naturally seen in a young
and comely couple.&nbsp; So again with the charming figure of the
Virgin sewing in the First Vision of St. Joseph chapel.&nbsp; The
Virgin and the Vecchietto are as unlike each other as two figures
can be, but they are both stamped with the same freedom from
affectation, and the same absolute and easy mastery over the
means employed.&nbsp; The same applies to the sleeping St.
Joseph, in which case there is a closer analogy between the two
figures themselves.&nbsp; It applies also to a not inconsiderable
extent to the man with a goitre who is leading Christ in the
Calvary chapel.&nbsp; This figure is not done from life, being a
repetition of one by Gaudenzio, but it is so living that we feel
sure it would have been more living still if Tabachetti had had
the model before him from which Gaudenzio in all probability
actually worked.&nbsp; At Crea, there are other figures by
Tabachetti to which I will call attention presently, and which
present not inconsiderable analogies to the Vecchietto.&nbsp; I
explain the fact that the analogies are not closer, by reflecting
that this is the one of the few cases in which Tabachetti has
left us a piece of portrait work, pure and simple, and that his
treatment of the head and figure in pure portraiture, would
naturally differ from that adopted in an ideal and imaginative
work.</p>

225</span>CHAPTER XV.&nbsp; THE PIET&Agrave; AND REMAINING
CHAPELS.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">The</span> remaining chapels are few in
number, and, whatever they may once have been, unimportant in
character.&nbsp; The first is</p>
<h3><span class="smcap">Chapel No</span>. 40.&nbsp; <span
class="smcap">The Piet&agrave;</span>.</h3>
<p>The three preceding chapels are supposed to be on Mount
Calvary, and from them we descend by a flight of stone steps to
the level of the piazza.&nbsp; Immediately on reaching this we
come upon the Piet&agrave;.&nbsp; We have seen that this chapel
originally contained Gaudenzio&rsquo;s Journey to Calvary, and
that the fresco background still, in so far as it is not
destroyed, treats this subject, while the modelled figures
represent the Piet&agrave;.&nbsp; Of Gaudenzio&rsquo;s original
work Caccia says:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Come fu Christo de&rsquo; panni
spogliato,<br />
Montando il Monte poi Calvario detto,<br />
Nel mezzo a manigoldi mal trattato,<br />
Contemplar possi con pietoso affetto,</p>
<p>Seguito da Maria e da l&rsquo;amato<br />
Discepolo di lui, et &egrave; l&rsquo;effetto<br />
Sculto si bene e doitamente fatto<br />
Che sembra vero e non del ver ritratto.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Per una scala asceso al Sacro Monte<br />
Si entra nel pi&ugrave; d&rsquo;ogn&rsquo; altro sacro
tempio,&rdquo; &amp;c.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The words &ldquo;<i>montando il monte poi</i>,&rdquo; &amp;c.,
must refer to a supposed ascent on the part of Christ Himself,
for Gaudenzio&rsquo;s work was on a level with Tabachetti&rsquo;s
present Journey to Calvary which Caccia has just described, and
Caccia goes on to say that from Gaudenzio&rsquo;s chapel (the
present Piet&agrave;) one &ldquo;ascends by a staircase to&rdquo;
the most sacred chapel of all&mdash;the Crucifixion&mdash;as one
does at present.&nbsp; That the present Piet&agrave; and the
adjacent Entombment chapels were once one chapel, may be seen by
any one who examines the vaulting inside the first-named
chapel.&nbsp; Signor Arienta pointed this out to me, and at the
same time called my attention to the fact that Gaudenzio&rsquo;s
fresco on the wall facing the spectator does not turn the corner
and join on with the subject that fills the left-hand wall.&nbsp;
A flag and a horse are cut off, and the rest of them is not
seen.&nbsp; I sometimes question whether the original
wooden-figured entombment was in the chapel in which the present
modern figures are seen, but it probably was so.</p>
<p>There was also a fainting Madonna mentioned in the prose part
of Caccia as a work by itself and described as
follows:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Come la Madonna &egrave; tramortita vedendo
N.S. condotto &agrave; morte.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is not referred to in the poetical part, and must have
been a mere cell occupied by a single figure.&nbsp; No doubt it
was seen through the window that is still approached by two steps
on the south side of the present Piet&agrave;, and the space it
occupied has been thrown into the present work.</p>
<p>I do not know when Gaudenzio&rsquo;s Journey to Calvary was
dispersed, but it was some time, doubtless, between 1600 and
1644.&nbsp; It is puzzling to note that the Piet&agrave; appears
in the plan of 1671 as situated rather in the part of the
building now occupied by the Entombment than by the Piet&agrave;,
while the 39 that should mark the site of the Entombment does not
appear; but this is perhaps only an error in the plan
itself.&nbsp; I find, however, the attempt to understand the
changes that have taken place here so difficult that I shall
abandon it and will return to the present aspect of the work.</p>
<p>Torrotti says that some of the statues in the present chapel
are by Gaudenzio, which they are not.&nbsp; Fassola gives them
all to Giovanni D&rsquo;Enrico; Bordiga speaks of the work in the
highest terms, but for my own part I do not admire it, nor, I am
afraid, can I accept the more fresh-looking parts of the fresco
background as by Gaudenzio.&nbsp; I do not doubt that his work
has been in these parts repainted, and that the outlines alone
are really his.&nbsp; It is not likely we have lost much by the
repainting, for where the work has not been touched it has so
perished as to be hardly worth preserving, and we may think that
what has been repainted was in much the same state.&nbsp; This is
the only chapel in which Gaudenzio&rsquo;s frescoes at Varallo
have been much repainted.&nbsp; If those in the Crucifixion and
Magi chapels have been retouched they have taken little harm; the
frescoes in the church of Sta. Maria delle Grazie have certainly
not been touched, and are in such good preservation that it may
be questioned whether they ever looked much better than they do
now.&nbsp; The fine oil picture in the church of S. Gaudenzio has
gone a little yellow through the darkening of the oil, but is in
a good state, and generally, though no painter of the highest
rank has been so much neglected, or suffered more from the actual
destruction of his works, yet for the most part Gaudenzio has
been spared the reckless restoration which is the most cruel ill
that can befall an artist.</p>
<h3><span class="smcap">Chapel No</span>. 41.&nbsp; <span
class="smcap">The Entombment</span>.</h3>
<p>We have already seen that this was the first chapel with
figures in it on the Sacro Monte.&nbsp; Of the old eight wooden
figures that it contained, two are still on the mountain in a
sort of vault adjacent to, or under, the main church, and near
the furnace in which those that superseded them were baked.&nbsp;
Six are in the Museum at Varallo.&nbsp; I saw them a few weeks
ago, not yet arranged, leaning up against the wall with very
battered and dilapidated glories; the recumbent Christ was
standing more or less on end, and the whole group was in a
pathetic state of dismemberment that will doubtless soon make way
for a return to their earlier arrangement.&nbsp; The figures are
interesting, but it cannot be pretended that they are of great
value.&nbsp; They look very much as if they had been out
somewhere the night before.</p>
<p>Of the figures in the present chapel the less said the
better.</p>
<h3><span class="smcap">Remaining Chapels and Chiesa
Maggiore</span>.</h3>
<p>The chapel of St. Francis is open to the air, and contains
nothing but an altar, and a modern fresco of the death of the
saint.</p>
<p>Near it is the Holy Sepulchre, which is entered from a small
cell in which there is a figure of the Magdalene, and from which
the visitor must creep on hands and knees into the Sepulchre
itself.&nbsp; The figure of Christ is not actually in the
Sepulchre, but can be seen through a window opening into the
contiguous chapel, where it is over the altar.&nbsp; The early
writers say that there were also two angels by Gaudenzio
(<i>statue di Gaudenzio divoissime</i>), but Bordiga says nothing
of this.&nbsp; The upper part of this building was the abode of
Bernardino Caimi and his successors until the year 1577.</p>
<p>As for the Holy Sepulchre itself it is low and dark, which I
have no doubt is the reason why I have neglected it on the
occasions of each of my two latest visits to Varallo, and thus
failed to reach the adjacent Oratory, which Bordiga says was
erected about the year 1702.&nbsp; Fassola and Torrotti wrote
before this date, so that the angels mentioned by them as by
Gaudenzio may have been removed when the present fabric was
erected.&nbsp; At any rate Bordiga speaks as though they were
paintings by one Tarquinio Grassi and not sculptured figures at
all.&nbsp; Torrotti says that visitors to the Holy Sepulchre used
to burn candles, tapers, and torches, each one according to his
purse or piety, and that they did this not so much to see with as
to pray.&nbsp; &ldquo;Here,&rdquo; he continues, &ldquo;the great
S. Carlo spent his evenings agreeably&rdquo; (<i>spendeva
gradevolmente le notti</i>).&nbsp; &ldquo;Few,&rdquo; he
concludes drily, and perhaps with a shade of the same quiet irony
that led the Psalmist to say what he did about &ldquo;one&rdquo;
day in certain courts, &ldquo;can leave it without feeling
devoutly thankful.&rdquo;&nbsp; About the candles Fassola says
that there was a kind of automatic arrangement for getting them
like that whereby we can now buy butter-scotch or matches at the
railway stations, by dropping a penny into a slot.&nbsp; He
says:&mdash;</p>
<p class="poetry">&ldquo;And as the figure of Christ can only be
seen by the help of candles (for which reason all pilgrims whose
means permit are accustomed to burn them, being naturally
prompted thereto each one according to his faith)&mdash;by
throwing money into a hole wherein the same candles lie, each
pilgrim can be made quite comfortable, and contented.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="poetry">[&ldquo;Gettando il denaro per un buco dove
stanno le medesime candelette, commodamente pu&ograve; restar
ogni divoto contento.&rdquo;]</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;The mercies vouchsafed here,&rdquo;
continues the same writer; &ldquo;are innumerable&mdash;in all
parts may be seen votive pictures both old and recent.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the open cloister hard by is shown the wooden bed on which
S. Carlo lay when he came to visit the Sacro Monte, and the stone
which is said to be a facsimile of the one rolled in front of the
Holy Sepulchre itself.&nbsp; Many years ago I spent several weeks
at Varallo sketching and painting on the Sacro Monte.&nbsp; A
most excellent and lovable old priest, now doubtless long since
dead, took rather a fancy to me, and used to implore me to become
a Catholic.&nbsp; One day he took me up to this stone and spoke
long and earnestly about it.&nbsp; What a marvellous miracle it
was.&nbsp; There was the stone; I could see it for myself.&nbsp;
What a dumb but eloquent testimony was it not offering; how could
I account for such things? and more to the same effect, all said
obviously in good faith, and with no idea save that of guiding me
to the truth.&nbsp; I was powerless.&nbsp; I could not go into
facts or arguments&mdash;I could not be obstinate without getting
something like his consent&mdash;and he was instant in season and
out of season in endeavouring to get mine.&nbsp; At last I could
stand it no longer, and said, &ldquo;My dearest sir, I am the son
of an English clergyman who is himself the son of another English
clergyman; my father and mother are living.&nbsp; If you will
tell me that I am to hold my father born in more than common sin,
to have committed a crime in marrying my mother, and that I am to
hold myself as one who ought never to have been born, then I will
accept what you have said about that stone.&nbsp; Till then let
me go my way, and you yours.&rdquo;&nbsp; He said not a word
more, and never again approached the subject; the nearest he ever
went to it was to say that he liked to see me sketching about the
Sacro Monte, for it could do me nothing but good.&nbsp; I trust
that I have done it no harm.</p>
<p>The chapel representing the Magdalene at the feet of the risen
Christ has disappeared.&nbsp; It contained two statues only, and
two prophets by Gaudenzio were painted outside on the wall.&nbsp;
It stood &ldquo;<i>Sotto un auanzo dei Portici antichi
seguentemente al Sepolcro</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp; It was probably a
very early work.</p>
<p>Through an arch under the raised portico or arcaded gallery
are three small ruined cells called now &ldquo;Il
Paradiso,&rdquo; and numbered 43, 44, and 45; of one of these
Fassola tells us that it contained &ldquo;many modern
statues&rdquo; by Gaudenzio Sceti, and frescoes by Gianoli; they
are all now mere wrecks.&nbsp; There is no important work by
Gaudenzio Sceti remaining on the Sacro Monte, but there is a
terra-cotta crucifix with a Virgin and a St. John by him, of no
great value, in the church of S. Gaudenzio.&nbsp; What remains of
his work on the Sacro Monte itself consists of statues of Sta.
Anna and the Virgin as a child upon her lap in the chapel or cell
numbered 43.</p>
<p>Chapel 44 need not detain us.&nbsp; What few remains of
figures it contains are uninteresting and ruined.</p>
<p>I have already spoken of chapel No. 45, which once represented
an entombment of the Madonna, as in all probability the oldest
building, and as certainly containing the oldest, and by no means
least interesting frescoes on the Sacro Monte.&nbsp; There is
nothing inside the chapel except these frescoes, but outside it
there are many scrawls, of which the earliest I have noticed is
1520&mdash;the supposed 1437 being certainly 1537.&nbsp; The
writer of one of these scrawls has added the words &ldquo;fuit
hic&rdquo; to his signature as John Van Eyck has done to the
signature of his portrait of John Arnolfini and his wife.&nbsp; I
have found this addition of &ldquo;fuit hic&rdquo; in a signature
of a certain &ldquo;Cardinalis de al . . . &rdquo; who scratched
his name &ldquo;1389 die 19 Mag&rdquo; on a fresco to the left of
the statue of S. Zenone in the church S. Zenone at Verona.&nbsp;
On a fresco in the very interesting castle of F&eacute;nis in the
valley of Aosta, to which I hope to return in another work, there
is scratched &ldquo;Hic sponsus cum spons&acirc; fuit 1790 25
May,&rdquo; the &ldquo;May&rdquo; being an English May; Jones and
I thought the writer had begun to add &ldquo;London&rdquo; but
had stopped.&nbsp; The &ldquo;fuit hic,&rdquo; therefore, of John
Van Eyck&rsquo;s signature should not be translated as we might
be tempted to wish to translate it, &ldquo;This was John Van
Eyck.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Returning to the Sacro Monte, there remains only the Chiesa
Vecchia, removed at the end of the last century to make room for
the building that was till lately the &ldquo;<i>casa degli
esercizi</i>,&rdquo; or house in which the priests on the
mountain performed their spiritual exercises.&nbsp; This is now
let out in apartments during the summer, and is called the
Casino.&nbsp; The old sacristy, now used as the <i>archivio</i>
of the Sacro Monte, still remains, and contains a fresco by
Lanini, that bears strong traces of the influence of his master
Gaudenzio.&nbsp; Besides the impress of Christ&rsquo;s foot and
the Assumption of the Virgin, the church contained an
Annunciation by Gaudenzio and frescoes of St. Catherine and St.
Cecilia; the Cupola was also decorated by him.&nbsp; This work
was undertaken in 1530, the greater angels being by Gaudenzio and
the smaller by Lanini and Fermo Stella.&nbsp; These frescoes all
perished when the church was pulled down.</p>
<p>The present Chiesa Maggiore was begun on the 9th of June
1614&mdash;D&rsquo;Enrico&rsquo;s design having, so Bordiga says,
been approved on the 1st of April in that year.&nbsp; Fassola
says that in 1671 the only parts completed were the Choir and
Cupola, the whole body of the church being left unfinished.&nbsp;
Bordiga speaks of the church as having been finished in 1649, in
which year, on the feast of the Birth of the Virgin, her image
was taken from the old church and placed in the new, so when
Fassola says &ldquo;unfinished&rdquo; he must refer to decoration
only.&nbsp; The steps leading up to the church and the unfinished
columns were erected in 1825 from designs by Marchese Don Luigi
Cagnola, the architect of the Arco della Pace at Milan.&nbsp; It
was ere long found that the stone selected was unreliable, so
that all must be done over again; the work has, therefore, been
suspended.</p>
<p>The Cupola is covered with about 140 modelled figures of
angels, by Dionigi Bussola and Giambattista Volpino, Milanese
sculptors, who worked from designs made by Antonio Tempesta, a
Florentine.&nbsp; They did this work about the year 1660.&nbsp;
The brothers Montalti painted the frescoes, some more highly
coloured groups being added by Antonio Cucchi of Milan in
1750.</p>
<p>In the crypt there is a sumptuous shrine containing the statue
of the Madonna, said to have been made by St. Luke.&nbsp; This
was erected in 1854, but on the night between the 4th and 5th of
October in the same year the crown was stolen from the
Virgin&rsquo;s head, and in the following year there was a solemn
expiatory function, with festivities extending over three days,
in order to celebrate the replacing of the stolen crown by a new
one.</p>
<p>It cannot be said that any of the works of art now in the
church are of considerable interest, but an important work of art
was nevertheless produced in it at the celebration of the fourth
centenary of the birth of Gaudenzio Ferrari, which was held in
1885.&nbsp; I refer to the Mass by Cagnoni, which was here
performed for the first time, and which showed that the best
traditions of old Italian ecclesiastical music are still
occasionally adhered to.&nbsp; I was present at the production of
the work, and have heard no modern Italian music that has pleased
me nearly as much.&nbsp; I ventured to ask the Maestro for the
baton he had used in conducting it, and am proud to keep it as a
memorial of a fine performance of a very fine work.&nbsp; The
baton is several old newspapers neatly folded up and covered with
silk.</p>

239</span>CHAPTER XVI.&nbsp; TABACHETTI&rsquo;S WORK AT
CREA.</h2>
<p>I <span class="smcap">have</span> now to add a short account
of what remains of Tabachetti&rsquo;s work at Crea, to the very
inadequate description of his work at Varallo that has been given
in some earlier chapters.</p>
<p>Crea is most easily approached from Casale, a large opulent
commercial town upon the Po, that has already received the waters
of the Dora Baltea, and though not yet swelled by the influx of
the Ticino and Adda, has become a noble river.&nbsp; The town is
built entirely on the plain, but the rich <i>colline</i> of the
Monferrato district begin to rise immediately outside it, and
continue in an endless series of vineclad slopes and
village-capped hill-tops as far as the eye can reach.&nbsp; These
<i>colline</i> are of exquisite beauty in themselves, and from
their sides the most magnificent views of Piedmont and the Alps
extend themselves in every direction.&nbsp; The people are a
well-grown comely race, kind and easy to get on with.&nbsp;
Nothing could exceed the civility and comfort of the Hotel Rosa
Rossa, the principal inn of the city.&nbsp; The town contains
many picturesque bits, but in our short stay we did not see any
very remarkable architectural features, and it does not form an
exception to the rule that the eastern cities of Northern Italy
are far more beautiful than the western.&nbsp; The churches,
never one would imagine very striking, have been modernised and
restored; nor were we told that there is any collection of
pictures in the town which is likely to prove of interest.</p>
<p>The visitor should leave Casale by the 7.58 <span
class="GutSmall">A.M.</span> train on the line for Asti, and get
out at Serralunga, the third station on the road.&nbsp; Here the
sanctuary of Crea can be seen crowning a neighbouring
<i>collina</i> with a chapel that has an arcaded gallery running
round it, like some of those at Varese.&nbsp; Many other chapels
testify to the former importance of the place; on the whole,
however, the effect of the buildings cannot compare with that of
the sanctuaries of Varallo and Varese.&nbsp; Taking a small
carriage, which can always be had at the station (fare, to the
sanctuary and back, eight francs), my friend, Mr. H. F. Jones,
and myself ascended to Serralunga, finding the views continually
become more and more bewitching as we did so; soon after passing
through Serralunga we reached the first chapel, and after another
zigzag or two of road found ourselves in the large open court in
front of the church.&nbsp; Here there is an inn, where any one
who is inclined to do so could very well sleep.&nbsp; The piazza
of the sanctuary is some two thousand feet above the sea, and the
views are in some respects finer even than those from the Sacro
Monte of Varese itself, inasmuch as we are looking towards the
chain of the Alps, instead of away from them.</p>
<p>We have already seen that the sanctuary at Crea was begun
about 1590, a hundred years or so later than the Sacro Monte of
Varallo, and a dozen years earlier than that of Varese.&nbsp; The
church attached to the convent, in which a few monks still
remain, contains a chapel with good frescoes by Macrino
D&rsquo;Alba; they are somewhat damaged, and the light is so bad
that if the <i>guardiano</i> of the sanctuary had not kindly lent
us a candle we could not have seen them.&nbsp; It is not easy to
understand how they can have been painted in such darkness; they
are, however, the most important work of this painter that I have
yet seen, and give a more favourable impression of him than is
likely to be formed elsewhere.&nbsp; Behind the high altar there
is an oil picture also by Macrino d&rsquo;Alba, signed as by the
following couplet, which they may scan who can:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Hoc tibi, diva parens, posuit faciente
Macrino<br />
Bladratensis opus Johes ille Jacobus.1503.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The &ldquo;Macrino,&rdquo; and &ldquo;1503,&rdquo; are in red
paint, the rest in black.&nbsp; The picture is so dark, and the
view of it so much obstructed by the high altar, that it is
impossible to see it well, but it seemed good.&nbsp; There is
nothing else in the church, nor need the frescoes in the chapels
containing the terra-cotta figures be considered; we were told
they were painted by Caccia, better known as Moncalvo, but we
could see nothing in them to admire.&nbsp; The sole interest of
the sanctuary&mdash;except, of course, the surpassing beauty of
its position&mdash;is vested in what few remains of
Tabachetti&rsquo;s work may be found there, and in the light that
these may throw upon what he has left at Varallo.</p>
<p>All the work by Tabachetti now remaining at Crea consists of
the Martyrdom of St. Eusebius chapel, almost all of which is by
him, perhaps a figure or two in the Sposalizio chapel, but
certainly not the figures of St. Joseph and the Virgin, which are
not even ascribed to him, the Virgin in the Annunciation chapel,
some parts of the Judith and Holofernes, with which this subject
is strangely backed; some few of the figures in the Marriage
Feast at Cana chapel, and lastly, the wreck, which is all that
remains, of the Assumption of the Virgin&mdash;commonly called
&ldquo;Il Paradiso.&rdquo;&nbsp; All the other chapels are either
in a ruined state or have been renewed with modern figures during
the last thirty years, and more especially during the last ten,
at the instance, and, as we understood, at the expense, of the
present Archbishop of Milan, who does his campagna here every
summer.</p>
<p>The most important chapel is the Martyrdom of St. Eusebius,
below the sanctuary itself.&nbsp; The saint is supposed to have
been martyred in front of the church of St. Andrea at
Vercelli.&nbsp; Some four or so of the figures to the
spectator&rsquo;s right are modern restorations; among them,
however, there is a child of extreme sweetness and beauty, which
must certainly be by Tabachetti, looking up and clinging to the
dress of its mother, who has been restored, and is as commonplace
as the child is the reverse.&nbsp; There are two restored or
rather entirely new priests close by the mother and child, and
near these is another new figure&mdash;a girl immediately to the
child&rsquo;s right; this is so absurdly bad and out of
proportion that it is not easy to understand how even the
restorer can have allowed himself to make it.&nbsp; All the rest
of the figures are by Tabachetti.&nbsp; A little behind the
mother and child, but more to the spectator&rsquo;s right, and
near to the wall of the chapel, there stands a boy one of whose
lower eyelids is paralysed, and whose expression is one of fear
and pain.&nbsp; This figure is so free alike from exaggeration or
shortcoming, that it is hard to praise it too highly.&nbsp;
Another figure in the background to the spectator&rsquo;s
left&mdash;that of a goitred <i>cr&eacute;tin</i> who is handing
stones to one of the stoners, has some of the same remarkably
living look as is observable in the two already referred to; so
also has another man in a green skull-cap, who is holding a small
battle-axe and looking over the stoner&rsquo;s shoulders.&nbsp;
Two of the stoners are very powerful figures.&nbsp; The man on
horseback, in the background, appears to be a portrait probably
of a benefactor.&nbsp; In spite of restoration, the work is still
exceedingly impressive.&nbsp; The figures behind the saint act
well together, the crowd is a crowd&mdash;a one in many, and a
many in one&mdash;not, as with every one except Tabachetti who
has tried to do a crowd in sculpture, a mere collection of units,
that, whatever else they may be, are certainly not crowding one
another.&nbsp; The main drawback of the work is that the chapel
is too small for the subject&mdash;a matter over which Tabachetti
probably had no control.</p>
<p>It is with very great regret that I have been unable to
photograph the work, but I was flatly refused permission to do
so, though I applied through influential people to the Archbishop
himself.&nbsp; No one need be at the trouble of going to see it
who is not already impressed with a sense of Tabachetti&rsquo;s
in some respects unrivalled genius, and who does not know how to
take into consideration the evil influences of all sorts with
which he was surrounded; those, however, who realise the
magnitude of the task attempted, who will be at the pains of
putting themselves, as far as may be, in the artist&rsquo;s place
and judging of the work from the stand-point intended by him, and
who will also in their imagination restore the damage which three
centuries of exposure and restoration must assuredly have
involved, will find themselves rewarded by a fuller comprehension
of the work of a sculptor of the foremost rank than they can
attain elsewhere except at Varallo itself.</p>
<p>I have said that some of the figures in the Sposalizio chapel,
except Joseph and Mary, are ascribed to Tabachetti.&nbsp; I do
not know on what grounds the ascription rests; they have been
restored,&mdash;clogged with shiny paint, and suffered every ill
that could well befall them short of being broken up and carted
away.&nbsp; Any one who sampled Tabachetti by these figures might
well be disappointed; two or three may be by him, but hardly
more.&nbsp; In spite, however, of all that may be justly urged
against them, they are marked by the same attempt at concert and
unity of purpose which goes so far to redeem individual
comparative want of interest.&nbsp; In the background is a
coloured bas-relief of Rachel and Jacob at the well and five
camels.</p>
<p>In the Annunciation chapel the Virgin may well be, as she is
said to be, by Tabachetti; she is a very beautiful figure, though
not so fine as his Madonna and Child in the church of St.
Gaudenzio at Varallo; she has been badly painted, and it is hard
to say how much she has not suffered in consequence.&nbsp; Some
parts of the story of Judith and Holofernes in the background are
also good, but I do not think I should have seen Tabachetti in
them unless I had been told that he was there.</p>
<p>The wreck of the chapel commonly called &ldquo;Il
Paradiso&rdquo; crowns the hill, conspicuous for many a mile in
every direction, but on reaching the grating we found no trace of
the figures that doubtless once covered the floor of the
chapel.&nbsp; All that remained was a huge pendant of angels,
cherubs, and saints, swarming as it were to the ceiling in an
inextricable knot of arms, legs, wings, faces, and flowing
drapery; two circles of saints, bishops, and others, who might be
fitly placed in Paradise, rising one above the other high up the
walls of the chapel&mdash;the lower circle full-length figures,
and the other half-length; and above this a higher and richly
coloured crown of musical saints and angels in good
preservation.&nbsp; In passing I may say that this is the place
where the Vecchietto ought to have come from, though it is not
likely that he did so.</p>
<p>The pendant retains much of its original colour, and must once
have been a gorgeous and fitting climax.&nbsp; Still, no one can
do much with such a subject.&nbsp; To attempt it is to fly in the
face of every canon by the observance of which art can alone give
lasting pleasure.&nbsp; It is to crib, cabin, and confine, within
the limits of well-defined sensation and perception, ideas that
are only tolerable when left in the utmost indefiniteness
consistent with thought at all.&nbsp; It is depressing to think
that he who could have left us portrait after portrait of all
that was noblest and loveliest in the men and women of his
age&mdash;who could give a life such as no one but himself, at
any rate at that time, could give&mdash;should have had to spend
months if not years upon a work that even when new can have been
nothing better than a magnificent piece of stage decoration.</p>
<p>But of such miscarriages the kingdom of art is full.&nbsp; In
the kingdom of art not only are many called and few chosen, but
the few that do get chosen are for the most part chosen amiss, or
are lavished in the infinite prodigality of nature.&nbsp; We
flatter ourselves that among the kings and queens of art, music,
and literature, or at any rate in the kingdom of the great dead,
all wrongs shall be redressed, and patient merit shall take no
more quips and scorns from the unworthy: there, if an able
artist, as, we will say, F. H. Potter just dead, dies poor,
neglected, and unable to fight his way through the ranks of men
with not a tenth part of his genius, there, at any rate, shall
right be done; there the mighty shall be put down from his seat,
and the lowly and meek, if clever as well as good, shall meet his
just reward.&nbsp; It is not so.&nbsp; There is no circle so
exalted but the devil has got the run of it.&nbsp; As for the
reputations of the great dead, they are governed in the main by
the chicane that obtains among the living; it is only after
generations of flourishing imposture, that even approximate right
gets done.&nbsp; Look at Raphael, see how he still reigns supreme
over those who have the people&rsquo;s ears and purses at
command.&nbsp; True, Guido, Guercino, and Domenichino have at
last tumbled into the abyss, and we know very well that Raphael
will ere long fall too, but Guido, Guercino, and Domenichino had
a triumph of some two hundred years, during which none dared lift
hand against them.&nbsp; Look again at that grossest of
impostors&mdash;Bacon.&nbsp; Look at by far the greater number of
the standard classical authors, painters, and musicians.&nbsp;
All that can be said is that there is a <i>nisus</i> in the right
direction which is not wholly in vain, and that though tens of
thousands of men and women of genius are as dandelion seeds borne
upon the air and perishing without visible result, yet there is
here and there a seed that really does take root and spring
upwards to be a plant on the whole more vigorous than that from
which it sprung.&nbsp; Right and truth and justice, in their
relation to human affairs, are as asymptotes which, though
continually drawing nearer and nearer to the curve, can never
reach it but by a violation of all on which their own existence
is founded.</p>
<p>As for the Assumption chapel, those who would see it even as a
wreck should lose no time; it is in full process of restoration;
it is swept and garnished for immediate possession by a gentleman
whom we met on the road down, and whose facility of execution in
making crucified Christs out of plaster of Paris is something
almost incredible.&nbsp; His type of face was Jewish, and it
struck both Jones and me that his proficiency must be in some
degree due to hereditary practice.&nbsp; He showed us one
crucifix which he had only begun at eight o&rsquo;clock that
morning, and by eleven was as good as finished.&nbsp; He told us
he had done the brand new Disputa chapel and the Agony in the
Garden with the beautiful blue light thrown all over Christ
through deep French ultramarine glass, and he was now going on
with the other chapels as fast as he could.&nbsp; He said they
had no oven for baking terra-cotta figures; besides, terra-cotta
was such a much slower material to work in; he could make a gross
of apostles in plaster more quickly than a single set of twelve
in terra-cotta, and the effect was just as good when painted; so
plaster of Paris and unrivalled facility of execution are to have
everything their own way.&nbsp; Already what I can only call a
shoddy bishop or pope or two, I forget which, have got in among
the circle of Tabachetti&rsquo;s saints and angels that still
remains.&nbsp; These are many of them portraits full of serious
dignity and unspotted by the world of <i>barocco</i> with which
Tabachetti was surrounded.&nbsp; At the present moment they have
been partly scraped and show as terra-cotta; no doubt they have
suffered not a little in the scraping and will do so still
further when they are repainted, but there is no help for
it.&nbsp; Great works of art have got to die like everything
else.</p>
<p>And, after all, it is as well they should, lest they come to
weigh us down too heavily.&nbsp; Why should a man live too long
after he is dead?&nbsp; For a while, yes, if he has done good
service in his generation, give him a new lease of life in the
hearts and memories of his successors, but do not let even the
most eminent be too exacting; do not let them linger on as
nonagenarians when their strength is now become but labour and
sorrow.&nbsp; We have statutes of mortmain to restrain the dead
hand from entering in among the living&mdash;why not a statute of
limitations or &ldquo;a fixed period&rdquo; as against
reputations and works of art&mdash;say a thousand years or
so&mdash;behind which time we will resolutely refuse to go,
except in rare cases by acclamation of the civilised world?&nbsp;
How is it to end if we go on at our present rate, with huge
geological formations of art and book middens accreting in every
city of Europe?&nbsp; Who is to see them, who even to catalogue
them?&nbsp; Remember the Malthusian doctrine, and that the mind
breeds in even more rapid geometrical ratio than the body.&nbsp;
With such a surfeit of art and science the mind pails and longs
to be relieved from both.&nbsp; As the true life which a man
lives is not in that consciousness in the midst of which the
thing he calls &ldquo;himself&rdquo; sits and the din and roar of
which confuse and deafen him, but in the life he lives in others,
so the true life a man&rsquo;s work should live after his death
is not in the mouths but in the lives of those that follow him;
in these it may live while the world lasts, as his lives who
invented the wheel or arch, but let it live in the use which
passeth all praise or thanks or even understanding, and let the
story die after a certain time as all things else must do.</p>
<p>Perhaps; but at any rate let us give them decent burial.&nbsp;
Crush the wounded beetle if you will, but do not try to mend
it.&nbsp; I am glad to have seen the remains of the Assumption
chapel while they are in their present state, but am not sure
whether I would not rather see them destroyed at once, than meet
the fate of restoration that is in store for them.&nbsp; At the
same time I am confident that no more competent restorer than the
able and eminent sculptor who has the work in hand is at all
likely to be found.&nbsp; My complaint is not against him, but
against the utter hopelessness of the task.&nbsp; I would again
urge those who may be induced to take an interest in
Tabachetti&rsquo;s work to lose no time in going to see what
still remains of it at Crea.</p>
<p>Last January I paid a second visit to Crea; and finding a
scaffolding up, was able to get on a level with the circle of
full-length figures.&nbsp; They were still unpainted, the
terra-cotta figures showing as terra-cotta and the plaster of
Paris white.&nbsp; When they are all repainted the visitor will
find it less easy to say which are new figures and which
old.&nbsp; I will therefore say that of the lower circle of
twenty full-length figures the only two entirely new figures are
the sixth to the left of the door on entering, which represents a
man holding an open book by his left hand and resting it on his
thigh, and the sixth figure to the right of the door on
entering.&nbsp; There are several unimportant restorations of
details of dress, feet, and clouds; the rest of the work in this
circle is all by Tabachetti.</p>
<p>In the circle of busts and half-length figures, the first new
work to the left of the door on entering is a figure that holds a
lamb, the two half-length figures that come next in sequence are
also new&mdash;the second of these is a nun holding a little
temple.&nbsp; The second upper choir of angels and saints is
still in its original [?] colour and seems to have been little
touched, as also the pendant.</p>
<p>The chapel containing the Marriage Feast at Cana has been much
restored and badly repainted.&nbsp; Most of the figures are very
poor, but some, and especially a waiter with his hair parted down
the middle, who is offering a hare (not cut up) to a guest who
seems to have had too much already, are very good indeed.&nbsp; I
find it difficult to think that this waiter can be by any one but
Tabachetti.&nbsp; The guitar-player is good, or rather was good
before he was repainted&mdash;so is a lady near him, so are some
of the waiters at the other end, and so are the bride and
bridegroom; at any rate they are life-like and effective as seen
from outside, but the chapel has suffered much from
restoration.</p>
<p>There is one other chapel at Crea which may be by Tabachetti
though I do not know that it is ascribed to him, I mean the one
containing figures of the founder and his wife, a little below
the main piazza.&nbsp; The shepherds and sheep to the left are
probably not by Tabachetti, but the lady is a well-modelled
figure.&nbsp; Both she, however, and her husband have been so
cruelly clogged with new paint that it is hard to form an opinion
about them.</p>
<p>On the piazza itself is a chapel representing the Birth of the
Virgin which is also pleasing.&nbsp; It is not always easy for us
English to tell the Birth of the Virgin from the Nativity, and it
may help the reader to distinguish these subjects readily if he
will bear in mind, that at the Birth of the Virgin the baby is
always going to be washed&mdash;which never happens at the
Nativity; this, and that the Virgin&rsquo;s mother is almost
invariably to have an egg, and generally a good deal more,
whereas the Virgin never has anything to eat or drink.&nbsp; The
Virgin&rsquo;s mother always wants keeping up.&nbsp; Gaudenzio
Ferrari has a Birth of the Virgin in the Church of S. Cristoforo
at Vercelli.&nbsp; The Virgin&rsquo;s mother is eating one egg
with a spoon, and there is another coming in on a tray, which I
think is to be beaten up in wine.&nbsp; Something more
substantial to follow is coming in on a hot plate with a cover
over it and a napkin.&nbsp; The baby is to be washed of course,
and the kind old head nurse is putting her hand in the bath,
while the under nurse pours in the hot water, to make sure that
the temperature is exactly right.&nbsp; It is to be just nicely
loo-warm.&nbsp; The bath itself is certainly a very little one;
it will hold about a pint and a half, but medieval washing
apparatus did run rather small, and Gaudenzio was not going to
waste more of his precious space than he could help upon so
uninteresting an object as a bath; in actual life the bath was
doubtless larger.&nbsp; The under-under nurse is warming a towel,
which will be nicely ready when the bath is over.&nbsp; Joachim
appears to have been in very easy circumstances, and the
arrangements could hardly be more commodious even though the
event had taken place at a certain well-known establishment in
the Marylebone Road.</p>
<p>At Milan, in a work that I only know by Pianazzi&rsquo;s
engraving, there are two eggs coming in on a tray, and they too,
I should say, are to be beaten up in wine.&nbsp; The under nurse
is again filling a very little bath with warm water, and the head
nurse is trying the temperature with her hand.&nbsp; There is no
room for the warming of the towel, but there is no question that
the towel is being warmed just out of the picture on the left
hand.&nbsp; Here, at Crea, the attendant is giving the
Virgin&rsquo;s mother a plain boiled egg, and has a spoon in her
hand with which she is going to crack it.&nbsp; The
Virgin&rsquo;s mother is frowning and motioning it away; she is
quite as well as can be expected; still she does not feel equal
to taking solid food, and the nurse is saying, &ldquo;Do try,
ma&rsquo;am, just one little spoonful, the doctor said you was to
have it, ma&rsquo;am.&rdquo;&nbsp; In the smaller picture by
Carpaccio at Bergamo she is again to have an egg; in the larger
she is to have some broth now, but a servant can be seen in the
kitchen plucking a fowl for dear life, so probably the larger
picture refers to a day or two later than the earlier.</p>
<p>The only other thing that struck us at Crea was the Virgin in
the Presentation chapel.&nbsp; She is so much too small that one
feels as though there must be some explanation that is not
obvious.&nbsp; She is not more than 2 ft. 6 in. high, while the
High Priest, and Joachim and St. Anne are all life-sized.&nbsp;
The Chief Priest is holding up his hands, and seems a good deal
surprised, as though he were saying&mdash;&ldquo;Well, St. Anne
my dear, I must say you are the very smallest Virgin that I ever
had presented to me during the whole course of my
incumbency.&rdquo;&nbsp; Joachim and St. Anne seem very much
distressed, and Joachim appears to be saying, &ldquo;It is not
our fault; I assure you, sir, we have done everything in our
power.&nbsp; She has had plenty of nourishment.&rdquo;&nbsp;
There must be some explanation of the diminutive size of the
figure that is not apparent.</p>

259</span>CHAPTER XVII.&nbsp; CONCLUSION.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">Returning</span> to Varallo, in the town
itself the most important work is the fresco by Gaudenzio Ferrari
in the church of Sta. Maria delle Grazie, already several times
referred to.&nbsp; The reader will find it fully described in the
pages of Colombo; moreover, in January last Signor Pizetta took
excellent negatives of all the compartments into which the work
is divided, and I learn that he has sent impressions&mdash;put
together so as to give a very good idea of the work&mdash;to the
Italian Exhibition that will open as these pages leave my
hands.&nbsp; I have myself also sent to the same Exhibition a few
unreduced impressions from the negatives used in the
illustrations that face earlier pages: these will give the reader
a more correct impression of the works from which they are taken
than he can get from the reduction.&nbsp; I do not yet know
whether they will be hung.</p>
<p>The fresco of Sta. Petronilla painted by Gaudenzio by
moonlight on a chapel just outside the town, is now little more
than a wreck.</p>
<p>There are a few works by Gaudenzio of no great importance in
the Pinacoteca of the Museum; a few frescoes by Lanini, one or
two drawings by Tanzio D&rsquo;Enrico, which show that he was a
well-trained draughtsman; two pictures by him, <i>barocco</i> in
character, but not without power, and other works of more or less
interest, are also in the Pinacoteca.</p>
<p>In the parish church of S. Gaudenzio, behind the altar, there
is an exceedingly fine Ancona by Gaudenzio, to which I have
already referred.&nbsp; Over an altar in the north transept, but
for the most part hidden behind a painted <i>tela</i>, is
Tabachetti&rsquo;s very beautiful Madonna del Rosario, which the
visitor should ask the Sacristan to show him; and last, but
hardly least, there is a Madonna by Dedomenici of Rossa&mdash;a
village higher up the Valsesia&mdash;painted on linen, in the
chapel dedicated to St. Joseph.</p>
<p>I referred to this last-named work in my book &ldquo;Alps and
Sanctuaries&rdquo; (pp. 177, &amp;c.), and have seen no reason to
modify the opinion I then expressed.&nbsp; I may repeat that
about twenty years ago I was much struck with the painting and
could not make out its strong and evidently unaffected medieval
feeling, yet modernness at the same time.&nbsp; On consulting the
Sacristan I learned that Dedomenici had died about 1840.&nbsp; He
added that the extraordinary thing was that Dedomenici had never
studied painting, and had never travelled out of the Valsesia;
that he had, in fact, acquired his art by doing rather than by
learning how to do.</p>
<p>This, as it appeared to me, explained his excellence.&nbsp; As
a general rule the more people study how to do things the more
hopelessly academic they become.&nbsp; Learning how to say ends
soon in having nothing to say.&nbsp; Learning how to paint, in
having nothing that one so longs to paint as to be unable to keep
one&rsquo;s hands off it.&nbsp; It gratifies the lust of doing
sufficiently to appease it, and then kills it.&nbsp; Learning how
to write music, ends in the dreary symphonies, operas, cantatas,
and oratorios which it seems are all that modern composers can
give us.&nbsp; The only way to study an art is to begin at once
with doing something that one wants very badly to do, and doing
it&mdash;even though it be only very badly.&nbsp; Study, of
course, but synchronously&mdash;letting the work be its own
exercises.</p>
<p>If a man defers doing till he knows how to do, when is the
hunting the <i>ignis fatuus</i> of a perfect manner to end, and
the actual work that he is to leave behind him to begin?&nbsp; I
know nothing so deadening, as a long course of preliminary study
in any art, and nothing so living as work plunged into at once by
one who is studying hard&mdash;over it, rather than in
preparation for it.&nbsp; Jones talking with me once on this
subject, and about <i>agape</i> as against <i>gnosis</i> in art,
said, &ldquo;Oh that men should put an enemy into their brains to
steal away their hearts.&rdquo;&nbsp; At any rate he and I have
written &ldquo;Narcissus&rdquo; on these principles, and are not
without hope that what it has lost in erudition it may have
gained in freshness.&nbsp; I have, however, dealt with the
question of how to study painting more at length in the chapter
on the Decline of Italian art in &ldquo;Alps and
Sanctuaries.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I said I would return to the chapel of Loreto a little way out
of Varallo on the road to Novara.&nbsp; This work has a lunette
which is generally, and I suppose correctly, ascribed to
Gaudenzio.&nbsp; It is covered with frescoes not of extraordinary
merit, but still interesting, and the chapel itself is extremely
beautiful.&nbsp; I had intended dwelling upon it at greater
length, but find that my space will not allow me to do so, though
I shall hope to describe it more fully in another work on Italy,
for which I have many notes that I have been unable to use
here.</p>
<p>And now to conclude.&nbsp; A friend once said to me on the
Sacro Monte, &ldquo;How is it that they have no chapel of the
Descent of the Holy Spirit?&rdquo;&nbsp; I answered that the work
of Gaudenzio Ferrari, Tabachetti, D&rsquo;Enrico, and Paracca was
a more potent witness to, and fitter temple for, the Holy Spirit,
than any that the hands even of these men could have made for it
expressly.&nbsp; For that there is a Holy Spirit, and that it
does descend on those that diligently seek it, who can for a
moment question?&nbsp; A man may speak lightly of the Father and
it shall be forgiven him; he may speak lightly of the Son and it
shall be forgiven him; but woe to him if he speak lightly of that
Divine Spirit, inspiration of which alone it is that makes a work
of art either true or permanently desirable.</p>
<p>Of the letter in which the Sacro Monte is written, I have at
times in the preceding pages spoken lightly enough.&nbsp; Who in
these days but the advocates whose paid profession it is to
maintain the existing order, and those whom custom and vested
interests hold enthralled, accepts the letter of Christianity
more than he accepts the letter of Oriental exaggerated
phraseology?&nbsp; If three days and three nights means in
reality only thirty-six hours, so should full fifty per cent. be
deducted wherever else seems necessary, and &ldquo;dead&rdquo; be
read as &ldquo;very nearly dead,&rdquo; and &ldquo;the Son of
God&rdquo; as &ldquo;rarely perfect man.&rdquo;&nbsp; Who, on the
other hand, that need be reckoned with, denies the eternal
underlying verity that there is an omnipresent unknown something
for which Mind, Spirit, or God, is, as Professor Mivart has well
said, &ldquo;the least misleading&rdquo; expression?&nbsp; Who
doubts that this Mind or God is immanent throughout the whole
universe, sustaining it, guiding it, living in it, he in it and
it in him?&nbsp; I heard of one not long since who said he had
been an atheist this ten years&mdash;and added, &ldquo;thank
God.&rdquo;&nbsp; Who, again, doubts that the spirit of
self-sacrifice for a noble end is lovelier and brings more peace
at the last than one of self-seeking and self-indulgence?&nbsp;
And who doubts that of the two great enemies both to religion and
science referred to in the passage I have taken for my motto,
&ldquo;the too much&rdquo; is even more dangerous than &ldquo;the
too little&rdquo;?</p>
<p>I, and those who think as I do, would see the letter whether
of science or of Christianity made less of, and the spirit
more.&nbsp; Slowly, but very slowly&mdash;far, as it seems to our
impatience, too slowly&mdash;things move in this direction.&nbsp;
See how even the Church of Rome, and indeed all churches, are
dropping miracles that they once held proper objects of faith and
adoration.&nbsp; The Sacro Monte is now singularly free from all
that we Protestants are apt to call superstition.</p>
<p>The miracles and graces so freely dealt in by Fassola and
Torrotti find no place in the more recent handbooks.&nbsp; The Ex
Votos and images in wax and silver with which each chapel
formerly abounded have long disappeared, and the sacred drama is
told with almost as close an adherence to the facts recorded in
the Gospels, as though the whole had been done by Protestant
workmen.&nbsp; Where is the impress of Christ&rsquo;s footprint
now? carted away or thrown into a lumber room as a child&rsquo;s
toy that has been outgrown&mdash;so surely as has been often said
do the famous words &ldquo;<i>E pur si muove</i>&rdquo; apply to
the Church herself, as well as to that world whose movement she
so strenuously denied.</p>
<p>The same thing is happening here among ourselves.&nbsp; As the
good churchmen at Varallo have thrown away their Flemish dancer,
their footprint of the Saviour, and their Virgins that box
thieves&rsquo; ears and persist in turning round and smiling even
after they have been asked not to do so, so we, by the mouths of
our Bishops, are flinging away our Genesis, our Exodus, and I
know not how much more.&nbsp; In the <i>Nineteenth Century</i>
for last December the Bishop of Carlisle says that the account of
Creation given in the Book of Genesis &ldquo;does not pretend to
be historical in any ordinary sense&rdquo;&mdash;or, in other
words, that it does not pretend to be historical, or true, at
all.&nbsp; Surely this is rather a startling jettison.&nbsp; The
Bishop goes on to say that &ldquo;the account of the flood is a
very precious tradition full of valuable teaching,&rdquo; and is,
he doubts not, a record of some great event that actually
occurred; &ldquo;but,&rdquo; he continues, &ldquo;I confess that
until Bishop Colenso brought his arithmetic to bear upon it and
some other portions of Old Testament history, I was quite [why
&ldquo;quite?&rdquo;] under the impression that the common sense
of Christians abstained from criticising this ancient record by
the canons applicable to ordinary history.&rdquo;&nbsp; This was
not my own impression, but the Bishop&rsquo;s is doubtless more
accurate.&nbsp; If things, however, go on at this rate, a hundred
years hence we shall have a Bishop writing to the <i>Twentieth
Century</i> that till X, Y or Z brought their canons of
historical criticism to bear on the Resurrection itself, he was
&ldquo;quite&rdquo; under the impression that the common sense of
Christians abstained from criticising this ancient record by the
canons applicable to ordinary history.&nbsp; The Bishop appeals,
and rightly, to common sense.&nbsp; This is of all courts the
safest and rightest to abide by, but it must not be forgotten
that the common sense of one generation is not that of the next,
and that the modification with which common sense descends cannot
be effected, however gently we may try to do so, without some
disturbance of the pre-existing common sense, and some reversal
of its decrees.</p>
<p>That the letter of the coming faith will be greatly truer than
that of the many that have preceded it I for one do not
believe.&nbsp; Let us have no more &ldquo;Lo heres&rdquo; and
&ldquo;Lo theres&rdquo; in this respect.&nbsp; I would as soon
have a winking Madonna or a forged decretal, as the doubtful
experiments or garbled articles which the high priests of modern
science are applauded with one voice for trying to palm off upon
their devotees; and I should look as hopefully for good result
from a new monastery, as from a new school of art, college of
music, or scientific institution.&nbsp; Whatever faith or science
the world at large bows down to will in its letter be tainted
with the world that worships it.&nbsp; Whoever clings to the
spirit that underlies all the science obtaining among civilised
peoples will assuredly find that he cannot serve God and
Mammon.&nbsp; The true Christ ever brings a sword on earth as
well as peace, and if he maketh men to be of one mind in an
house, he divideth a house no less surely.&nbsp; The way will be
straight in the future as in the past.&nbsp; All that can be
hoped for is that it may perhaps become a trifle more easy
through the work of the just men made perfect through suffering
that have gone before, and that he who in bygone ages would have
been burnt will now be only scouted.</p>
<p>I have in the last few foregoing pages been trenching on
somewhat dangerous ground, but who can leave such a work as the
Sacro Monte without being led to trench on this ground, and who
that trenches upon it can fail to better understand the lesson of
the Sacro Monte itself?&nbsp; I am aware, however, that I have
said enough if not too much, and will return to the note struck
at the beginning of my work&mdash;namely, that I have endeavoured
to stimulate study of the great works on the Sacro Monte rather
than to write the full account of them which their importance
merits.&nbsp; At the same time I must admit that I have had great
advantages.&nbsp; Not one single previous writer had ever seen an
earlier work than that of Fassola, published in 1670 [1], whereas
I have had before me one that appeared in 1586 [7].&nbsp; I had
written the greater part of my book before last Christmas, and
going out to Varallo at the end of December to verify and
reconsider it on the spot, found myself forced over and over
again to alter what I had written, in consequence of the new
light given me by the 1586 [7] and 1590 [1] editions of
Caccia.&nbsp; It is with profound regret that though I have
continued to search for the 1565 and 1576 editions up to the very
last moment that these sheets leave my hands, my search has been
fruitless.</p>
<p>Over and above the advantage of having had even the later
Caccia before me, I have seen Cav. Aless. Godio&rsquo;s
&ldquo;Cronaca di Crea,&rdquo; which no previous writer had done,
inasmuch as this work has been only very lately published.&nbsp;
Moreover, when I was at Varallo, it being known that I was
writing on the Sacro Monte, every one helped me, and so many gave
me such important and interesting information that I found my
labour a very light and pleasant one.&nbsp; Especially must I
acknowledge my profound obligations to Signor Dionigi Negri, town
clerk of Varallo, to Signor Galloni the present director of the
Sacro Monte, to Cav. Prof. Antonini and his son, Signori Arienta
and Tonetti, and to many other kind friends whom if I were to
begin to name I must name half the town of Varallo.&nbsp; With
such advantages I am well aware that the work should be greatly
better than it is; if, however, it shall prove that I have
succeeded in calling the attention of abler writers to Varallo,
and if these find the present work of any, however small,
assistance to them, I shall hold that I have been justified in
publishing it.&nbsp; In the full hope that this may turn out to
be the case, I now leave the book to the generous consideration
and forbearance of the reader.</p>

effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm

LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
